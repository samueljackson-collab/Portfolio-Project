# Deployable Projects Index

The portfolio is organized into five capability areas. Every project provides Terraform and automation
stubs that can be extended into production-grade implementations.

## Project Summary

| Category | Projects | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Cloud Infrastructure | 6 | Landing zone, networking, serverless, and disaster recovery foundations. |
| Security & Compliance | 6 | Zero trust, compliance automation, secrets governance, and posture management. |
| DevOps & Automation | 6 | GitOps, CI/CD, monitoring, internal platform, and ChatOps experiences. |
| Full-Stack Applications | 6 | Reference applications demonstrating delivery patterns across channels. |
| Data Engineering | 6 | Streaming, analytics, ML operations, and governance accelerators. |
