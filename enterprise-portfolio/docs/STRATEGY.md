# Portfolio Strategy

## Vision
Deliver a secure, automated, and data-driven platform that accelerates digital product teams while
maintaining enterprise guardrails.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Product-aligned teams** – Technology capabilities are grouped into deployable projects that map to
   business outcomes.
2. **Automation-first** – Infrastructure, compliance, and deployments are fully automated via scripts and
   GitOps pipelines.
3. **Secure by design** – Zero-trust patterns, secrets management, and compliance automation are built in
   from the start.
4. **Observability everywhere** – Every workload emits metrics, logs, and traces to shared dashboards.
5. **Incremental delivery** – Focus on high-value slices that can be deployed independently.

## Success Metrics

- Time to provision a new environment reduced from weeks to hours.
- 100% infrastructure under Terraform management.
- Continuous compliance reporting with actionable remediation playbooks.
- Consistent SLOs across cloud, platform, and application services.
