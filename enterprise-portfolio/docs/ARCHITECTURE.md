# Architecture Overview

The enterprise portfolio layers infrastructure, platform services, and workloads to deliver an
end-to-end digital ecosystem.

## Layers

1. **Foundation Cloud Infrastructure**
   - Multi-account AWS landing zone with centralized networking.
   - Cross-cloud Kubernetes footprint for portable workloads.
   - Automated disaster recovery with regular failover testing.

2. **Security & Governance**
   - Zero-trust enforcement through identity, network segmentation, and encryption.
   - Continuous compliance checks using policy-as-code guardrails.
   - Secrets lifecycle management with automatic rotation.

3. **DevOps & Platform Enablement**
   - GitOps pipelines with Argo CD syncing Kubernetes manifests.
   - Golden CI/CD pipelines with quality, security, and compliance gates.
   - Internal developer platform exposing golden paths for product teams.

4. **Application Delivery**
   - Microservices, serverless APIs, and real-time workloads deployed through GitOps.
   - Shared observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki/Tempo) for uniform telemetry.
   - Platform-managed ingress, service mesh, and policy controllers.

5. **Data & Analytics**
   - Streaming pipelines feeding governed data lakes and BI platforms.
   - MLOps workflows for model experimentation, deployment, and monitoring.
   - Data governance enforcing cataloging, lineage, and quality metrics.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Observability** – Standardized metrics, logs, traces, and alerting.
- **Security** – Shift-left and in-production controls for identities, data, and workloads.
- **Scalability** – Auto-scaling infrastructure and stateless services.
- **Automation** – IaC-first mindset with Terraform, GitOps, and policy automation.
