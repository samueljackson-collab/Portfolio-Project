# Data Retention Policy

## Scope

This policy covers portfolio content, automation artifacts, audit logs, and operational metrics generated by the Portfolio API platform.

## Retention Requirements

| Data Type | Retention Period | Storage Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Portfolio entries & metadata | 7 years | Aurora PostgreSQL with encrypted snapshots |
| Evidence assets (files) | 5 years | S3 bucket `portfolio-<env>-evidence` |
| Audit logs | 1 year online, 7 years archived | CloudWatch Logs (online), S3 Glacier Deep Archive |
| Metrics & traces | 13 months | Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus / AWS X-Ray |

## Purge Process

1. Identify records eligible for deletion using `documentation/runbooks/data-retention.md` queries.
2. Queue deletion jobs via `/api/v1/exports` with the `delete_after_export` flag.
3. Validate that S3 objects are removed and RDS tables contain tombstone entries.
4. Record completion in the compliance register located in [`documentation/security/compliance-register.md`](./../../documentation/security/compliance-register.md).

## Legal Holds

- Legal or contractual holds supersede this policy. Place holds via the governance portal documented in [`documentation/runbooks/legal-hold.md`](./../../documentation/runbooks/legal-hold.md).

## Review Cycle

- Reviewed quarterly by the Security & Compliance working group.
- Changes require approval from the Data Protection Officer and Engineering leadership.
