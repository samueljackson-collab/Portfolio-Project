# Migration Notes: Portfolio Bootstrap Kit Integration

## Overview
The Portfolio Bootstrap Kit assets from `portfolio_bootstrap_kit.zip` have been merged into this repository. The import introduced tooling for generating starter structures, packaging scripts, prompt specifications, and documentation outlines that align with the Prompt 0A contract.

## Conflict Resolution
No conflicting files were detected when applying the kit to the existing repository. All new files were introduced alongside the pre-existing README.

## Follow-up Actions
- Use `tools/bootstrap.py --dry-run` to preview scaffold actions before creating additional resources.
- Update diagram placeholders under `docs/assets/` with finalized visual artifacts that match the references in the documentation files.
- Review `prompts/BUILD_SPEC.json` for customization specific to future portfolio updates.
