# ADR-003: Integrate Artifacts with Documentation Indexes

- **Date:** 2025-11-14
- **Status:** Accepted

## Context
To keep documentation discoverable, the master factory deliverables require every artifact to register with the portfolio-wide indexes, including the master index, documentation hub, and wiki navigation layers.【F:docs/master_factory_deliverables.md†L345-L348】

## Decision
Enforce index registration for any new or updated artifact. Each documentation deliverable must include links in the portfolio indexes and relevant navigation files to ensure cross-references stay synchronized.

## Consequences
- Improves discoverability and reduces duplication across the portfolio.
- Adds a verification step during reviews to confirm index updates accompany content changes.
- Keeps navigation consistent for downstream consumers such as Wiki.js.
- Requires periodic audits to ensure stale links are removed or corrected.
