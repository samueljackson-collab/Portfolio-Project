# ADR-005: Establish Quarterly Governance Cadence

- **Date:** 2025-11-14
- **Status:** Accepted

## Context
A regular governance cadence is required to align deliverables with evolving standards and to synchronize training materials, templates, and automation scripts. Quarterly reviews keep the documentation factory current with portfolio needs.【F:docs/master_factory_deliverables.md†L352-L356】

## Decision
Set a quarterly governance cycle for the documentation factory. Each quarter, stakeholders will review deliverables, update templates and training content, and adjust automation scripts to reflect new standards or lessons learned.

## Consequences
- Keeps documentation practices aligned with organizational changes.
- Ensures training and automation stay relevant without ad-hoc updates.
- Requires scheduling and ownership for recurring review sessions.
- Provides predictable windows for larger process improvements.
