# ADR-002: Maintain Numbered Decision Logs

- **Date:** 2025-11-14
- **Status:** Accepted

## Context
Governance expectations call for numbered ADRs that record context, decisions, and consequences for architectural and process changes. This ensures auditability and clarity on why choices were made over time.【F:docs/master_factory_deliverables.md†L341-L345】

## Decision
Mandate ADR creation for significant architectural, process, and governance changes across the portfolio. Each ADR must include clear context, an explicit decision statement, and documented consequences. ADRs will be stored in the `adr/` directory with incremental numbering and cross-links to relevant documentation.

## Consequences
- Creates an authoritative decision history that supports audits and onboarding.
- Encourages deliberate evaluation before committing to changes.
- Adds lightweight overhead to capture reasoning but prevents ambiguity later.
- Requires index updates so new ADRs remain discoverable.
