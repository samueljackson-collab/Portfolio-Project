# ADR-004: Enforce Quality and Release Controls

- **Date:** 2025-11-14
- **Status:** Accepted

## Context
The deliverables prescribe pre-release checklists that verify templates, links, and runbooks before publishing documentation updates. These controls prevent regressions and ensure factory outputs meet the expected standard.【F:docs/master_factory_deliverables.md†L348-L352】

## Decision
Adopt mandatory pre-release quality gates for documentation releases. Prior to publication, teams must complete the checklist covering template conformity, link validation, runbook currency, and other factory-defined criteria. Publication proceeds only after checklist sign-off.

## Consequences
- Reduces the risk of broken links or outdated instructions reaching consumers.
- Provides a repeatable sign-off mechanism for stakeholders.
- Introduces an additional step in release workflows that may extend timelines slightly.
- Encourages automation to validate checklist items where feasible.
