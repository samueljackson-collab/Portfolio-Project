# ADR-001: Establish Documentation Factory Pipeline

- **Date:** 2025-11-14
- **Status:** Accepted

## Context
The portfolio needs a consistent flow for creating, reviewing, and publishing documentation artifacts. The master factory deliverables define a centralized pipeline covering intake, authoring, review, and publication, emphasizing repeatable quality gates and hand-offs to keep outputs reliable and predictable.【F:docs/master_factory_deliverables.md†L335-L341】

## Decision
Adopt the documentation factory pipeline as the default operating model for all new and existing documentation workstreams. Each effort must enter through a standard intake, follow the prescribed authoring and review stages, and publish through the factory-controlled release steps to maintain consistency across the portfolio.

## Consequences
- Provides uniform checkpoints that reduce variance in documentation quality.
- Simplifies onboarding by giving contributors a single, repeatable process.
- Centralizes ownership of publication steps, reducing drift across teams.
- Requires initial training and updates to tooling so contributors follow the factory path.
