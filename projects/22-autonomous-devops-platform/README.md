# Project 22 ¬∑ Autonomous DevOps Platform

## üìå Overview
Create a self-driving DevOps platform that orchestrates CI/CD, infrastructure drift remediation, and incident response with AI-assisted decision-making. The system blends policy-as-code, event-driven automation, and reinforcement learning to continuously improve delivery.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights
- **Event backbone** using Kafka and EventBridge to capture Git events, deployment telemetry, and incident signals.
- **Control plane** built on Argo Workflows, Terraform Cloud, and FluxCD for GitOps-driven delivery and IaC management.
- **AI Ops layer** employing reinforcement learning agents to recommend rollout strategies, canary windows, and hotfix plans.
- **Incident automation** with StackStorm + PagerDuty orchestrating runbooks, guardrails, and post-incident retrospectives.
- **Observability feedback loop** leveraging SLO dashboards, error budgets, and auto-generated change summaries.

```
Code Commit -> Policy Evaluation -> Automated Pipeline -> Progressive Delivery -> Observability Feedback -> Learning Agent
```

## üöÄ Implementation Steps
1. **Deploy Kafka clusters** and define event schemas for deployments, incidents, and compliance signals.
2. **Configure policy-as-code** using Open Policy Agent to evaluate merge requests, Terraform plans, and Argo rollouts.
3. **Implement autonomous workflows** where StackStorm triggers Terraform or Argo jobs based on drift detection or SLO breaches.
4. **Train reinforcement learning agent** using historical deployment metrics to choose between blue/green, canary, or rolling strategies.
5. **Integrate chatOps** with Slack bots summarizing deployment outcomes, test results, and recommended mitigations.
6. **Automate postmortems** by aggregating logs, timeline events, and metrics into Notion/Confluence templates.
7. **Measure platform KPIs** such as lead time for changes, MTTR, and change failure rate with automated quarterly reports.

## üß© Key Components
```python
# projects/22-autonomous-devops-platform/automation/policy_handler.py
from opa_client.opa import OpaClient
import requests

def evaluate_change(plan_artifact: str, metadata: dict) -> bool:
    opa = OpaClient(host="http://opa:8181")
    response = opa.evaluate(
        policy_name="portfolio.cicd",
        input_data={
            "plan": plan_artifact,
            "metadata": metadata,
        },
    )
    decision = response[0].get("result", {}).get("allow", False)
    if not decision:
        requests.post(metadata["callback_url"], json={"status": "denied"})
    return decision
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Fail-safes & Operations
- **Human-in-the-loop controls** requiring manual approval for high-risk changes while autonomous mode handles routine tasks.
- **Shadow mode deployments** letting AI agents simulate decisions before taking production control.
- **Drift safeties** with Terraform Cloud run tasks halting applies if policy violations or anomalies are detected.
- **Continuous governance** using monthly scorecards presented to leadership with audit trails for every automated action.
