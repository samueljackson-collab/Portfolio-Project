# Legacy Projects Directory

This directory now primarily houses historical workstreams (homelab rebuilds, commercial recoveries, etc.) that pre-date the standardized enterprise portfolio.

- **Active enterprise templates (P01–P20)** now live in `../projects-new/`. Use the quick start guide at `../projects-new/QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` for navigation and automation scripts.
- **Legacy assets** under `01-*`, `06-*`, etc. remain for reference while missing evidence is backfilled. Follow the root `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` for instructions on populating those paths.

> ⚠️ The former `./projects/1-*` directories are deprecated. Do not add new material there—redirect contributions to the matching `./projects-new/PXX-*` folder instead.
