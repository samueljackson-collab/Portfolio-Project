# Projects Directory

This tree houses homelab builds, commercial recovery work, and other bespoke deliverables that pre-date the standardized enterprise blueprints.

## Canonical Enterprise Projects

- P01–P20 now live in `../projects-new/`
- Reference playbook: [`projects-new/QUICK_START_GUIDE.md`](../projects-new/QUICK_START_GUIDE.md)
- Use commands such as `cd projects-new/P01-aws-infra` when working with the standardized templates

The numbered directories (for example `1-aws-infrastructure-automation/`, `10-blockchain-smart-contract-platform/`, etc.) remain as legacy references while documentation and evidence are rebuilt. They are intentionally labeled as historical so that the canonical navigation stays focused on `projects-new/`.
