# Project 10: Blockchain Smart Contract Platform
> **Category:** Blockchain & Web3 | **Status:** 🟢 70% Complete
> **Source:** projects/25-portfolio-website/docs/projects/10-blockchain.md

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Decentralized finance (DeFi)** protocol with modular smart contracts for staking, governance, and treasury management. Built with **Hardhat** tooling, TypeScript tests, and CI pipelines enforcing security analysis, linting, and comprehensive test coverage.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Staking Protocol** - Token staking with dynamic APY calculations
- **Governance System** - Time-locked voting and proposal execution
- **Treasury Management** - Multi-sig wallet with spending limits
- **Security Hardened** - Slither static analysis, OpenZeppelin libraries
- **Upgradeable** - Transparent proxy pattern for contract evolution

**Contract Architecture:**
1. **PortfolioStaking.sol**: Stake tokens, earn rewards, compound
2. **Governance.sol**: Proposal creation, voting, execution
3. **Treasury.sol**: Multi-sig spending with role-based access
4. **ProxyAdmin.sol**: Upgradeable contract administration

### Components

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Solidity | Solidity | Smart contract language (0.8.x) |
| Hardhat | Hardhat | Ethereum development framework |
| TypeScript | TypeScript | Type-safe test and deployment scripts |

## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Adopt Solidity
**Context:** Project 10: Blockchain Smart Contract Platform requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** Smart contract language (0.8.x)
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

### Decision 2: Adopt Hardhat
**Context:** Project 10: Blockchain Smart Contract Platform requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** Ethereum development framework
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

### Decision 3: Adopt TypeScript
**Context:** Project 10: Blockchain Smart Contract Platform requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** Type-safe test and deployment scripts
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

```bash
cd projects/10-blockchain-smart-contracts

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run test suite
npx hardhat test

# Static analysis
./scripts/analyze.sh

# Deploy to local network
npx hardhat node  # Terminal 1
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost  # Terminal 2

# Deploy to testnet (Sepolia)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia
```
