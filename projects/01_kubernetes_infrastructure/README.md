# Project 1: Enterprise Kubernetes Infrastructure

## Executive Summary
Design and deploy a production-ready Kubernetes platform on AWS using Terraform. The platform supports multi-team workloads, enforces cost controls, and provides operational guardrails.

## Business Value
- Accelerated application delivery via self-service namespaces and GitOps deployment patterns.
- Reduced infrastructure spend through right-sized node groups and automated shutdown of non-production environments.
- Improved reliability with multi-AZ design, managed backups, and documented runbooks.

## Soft Skills Demonstrated
- **Leadership:** Facilitated architecture reviews with platform, security, and finance stakeholders.
- **Communication:** Authored runbooks and recorded walkthroughs for application teams onboarding to the cluster.
- **Collaboration:** Worked with security engineers to align network policies and IAM boundaries.

## Key Deliverables
- Terraform modules for VPC, EKS, and supporting services.
- Kubernetes baseline configuration (namespaces, RBAC, network policies).
- Observability integration (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager) and logging.
- Runbooks for cluster upgrades, node scaling, and incident response.

## Directory Map
- `architecture/` – Diagrams and design docs.
- `code/` – Terraform modules, Helm charts, automation scripts.
- `docs/adr/` – Architecture decision records.
- `docs/runbook.md` – Operational procedures.
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` – Known issues and resolutions.
- `assets/` – Screenshots, metrics exports, presentation slides.

## Implementation Phases
1. **Foundation:** Provision networking, IAM, and baseline EKS cluster.
2. **Platform Services:** Deploy ingress, DNS, certificate management, and secrets handling.
3. **Observability:** Configure metrics, logging, and alerting integrations.
4. **Governance:** Apply policies for cost management, security, and workload isolation.
5. **Runbooks & Evidence:** Document procedures, record demos, and collect metrics.

## Success Metrics
- Cluster provisioning time reduced from days to hours via Terraform automation.
- 99.9% uptime achieved for control plane and critical workloads.
- 20% cost reduction by implementing scheduled scaling and rightsizing recommendations.
