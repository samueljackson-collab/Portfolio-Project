## 📊 Portfolio Status Board

🟢 Done · 🟠 In Progress · 🔵 Planned

**Current Status:** 🟢 Done (Implemented)


## Overview
Hybrid key exchange service that combines Kyber KEM with classical ECDH for defense-in-depth.

## Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/key_exchange.py
```


## Code Generation Prompts

This section contains AI-assisted code generation prompts that can help you recreate or extend project components. These prompts are designed to work with AI coding assistants like Claude, GPT-4, or GitHub Copilot.

### Quantum Computing

#### 1. Quantum Circuit
```
Create a Qiskit quantum circuit that implements Grover's algorithm for searching an unsorted database, including oracle construction and amplitude amplification
```

#### 2. Quantum Simulation
```
Generate a quantum simulation using Cirq that models a quantum system's evolution, measures observables, and visualizes state probabilities
```

#### 3. Hybrid Algorithm
```
Write a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) implementation that combines quantum circuits with classical optimization for molecular energy calculations
```

### How to Use These Prompts

1. **Copy the prompt** from the code block above
2. **Customize placeholders** (replace [bracketed items] with your specific requirements)
3. **Provide context** to your AI assistant about:
   - Your development environment and tech stack
   - Existing code patterns and conventions in this project
   - Any constraints or requirements specific to your use case
4. **Review and adapt** the generated code before using it
5. **Test thoroughly** and adjust as needed for your specific scenario

### Best Practices

- Always review AI-generated code for security vulnerabilities
- Ensure generated code follows your project's coding standards
- Add appropriate error handling and logging
- Write tests for AI-generated components
- Document any assumptions or limitations
- Keep sensitive information (credentials, keys) in environment variables
