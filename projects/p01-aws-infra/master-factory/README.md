This package captures the master factory deliverables for the P01 AWS Infrastructure Automation track. It consolidates reference diagrams, implementation prompts, test strategy, operational playbooks, reporting, observability, security, risk, architecture decisions, and a concise business narrative aligned to the existing VPC + RDS stack and DR automation.

## Deliverable Map
- `diagrams.md`: System, CI/CD, and IaC diagrams (Mermaid + ASCII).
- `code-prompts.md`: Structured prompts for infrastructure-as-code and automation updates.
- `testing-suite.md`: Unit, integration, and DR drill validation coverage.
- `operations.md`: Runbooks, deployment steps, and incident response.
- `reporting.md`: KPIs and evidence capture guidelines.
- `observability.md`: Metrics, logs, and tracing expectations.
- `security.md`: Controls, guardrails, and validation hooks.
- `risk.md`: Risk register with mitigations.
