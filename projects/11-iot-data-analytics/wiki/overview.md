# Project 11: IoT Data Ingestion & Analytics
> **Category:** IoT & Edge Computing | **Status:** 🟡 45% Complete
> **Source:** projects/25-portfolio-website/docs/projects/11-iot.md

## 📋 Executive Summary

Edge-to-cloud ingestion stack with **MQTT telemetry**, AWS IoT Core integration, and **TimescaleDB** analytics. Simulates IoT device fleets, streams sensor data through AWS managed services, and provides real-time dashboards for anomaly detection.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **MQTT Messaging** - Lightweight pub/sub for constrained devices
- **Device Simulation** - Configurable simulators for testing at scale
- **Stream Processing** - AWS IoT Rules → Kinesis Firehose pipeline
- **Time-Series Storage** - TimescaleDB for efficient sensor data queries
- **Anomaly Detection** - Grafana dashboards with alerting

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
IoT Devices (Simulated) → MQTT Broker → AWS IoT Core
                                             ↓
                                      IoT Rules Engine
                                             ↓
                                  Kinesis Data Firehose
                                             ↓
                          Lambda (Transform & Enrich)
                                             ↓
                                      TimescaleDB
                                             ↓
                                  Grafana Dashboards
```

**Data Flow:**
1. **Device Layer**: Simulated devices publish MQTT messages
2. **Ingestion**: AWS IoT Core receives telemetry
3. **Routing**: IoT Rules filter and route messages
4. **Buffering**: Kinesis Firehose batches for efficiency
5. **Transformation**: Lambda enriches and formats data
6. **Storage**: TimescaleDB hypertables for time-series optimization
7. **Visualization**: Grafana queries and displays metrics

## 🔧 Implementation Details

```bash
cd projects/11-iot-data-ingestion

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run device simulator (local)
python src/device_simulator.py --device-count 10 --interval 2

# Publish to AWS IoT Core (requires AWS setup)
python src/device_simulator.py \
  --endpoint a3xyz.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com \
  --device-count 50 \
  --interval 5

# View TimescaleDB data
psql -h localhost -d iot_db -c "SELECT * FROM sensor_readings LIMIT 10;"
```
