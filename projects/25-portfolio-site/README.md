# Project 25 â€“ Portfolio Site

This project will iterate on a modern, performant personal portfolio site that showcases engineering work with rich documentation. The repository is scaffolded to hold upcoming design, implementation, and deployment artifacts.

## Directory Structure
- `docs/`: Project documentation bundle (proposal, architecture, implementation, runbook, roadmap).
- `src/`: Placeholder for the web application source code, build tooling, and infrastructure configs.

## Status
This project is currently in initial planning. Documentation in [`docs/`](./docs/) will drive upcoming milestones and implementation efforts.
