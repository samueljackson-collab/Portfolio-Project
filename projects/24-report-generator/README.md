# Project 24 â€“ Report Generator

This project will deliver a lightweight report generation service that can assemble templated data exports for stakeholders. Documentation and implementation assets are being scaffolded here so future workstreams can iterate quickly.

## Directory Structure

- `src/`: Placeholder for application source code and infrastructure assets.

## Status
This project is in the planning phase. Refer to the documents in [`docs/`](./docs/) as they are fleshed out.
