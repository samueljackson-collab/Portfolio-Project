  "classification": "Internal",
  "company_name": "Global Manufacturing Corp",
  "department": "IT Infrastructure",
  "project_code": "CLOUD-MIG-ERP-2024",
  "executive_summary": "This assessment evaluates the feasibility and strategy for migrating Global Manufacturing Corp's on-premises ERP system to Amazon Web Services (AWS). The current infrastructure consists of 85 servers supporting SAP ERP, Oracle databases, and custom integrations serving 5,000+ users globally. Our analysis recommends a phased 18-month migration approach using the AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP). Total project cost is estimated at $2.8M with projected 3-year TCO savings of $4.2M (35% reduction) and improved RTO/RPO from 8hrs/4hrs to 1hr/15min.",
  "background": "Global Manufacturing Corp operates a mission-critical ERP system on-premises across three data centers (US East, EU West, APAC). The infrastructure is 7+ years old, approaching end-of-life, and requires significant capital investment for hardware refresh. The company's digital transformation initiative mandates cloud-first architecture for scalability, disaster recovery, and operational efficiency.",
  "objectives": [
    "Assess cloud readiness of current ERP infrastructure and applications",
    "Design target AWS architecture following Well-Architected Framework principles",
    "Develop phased migration strategy minimizing business disruption",
    "Calculate Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) comparing on-premises vs. AWS",
    "Identify risks, dependencies, and mitigation strategies",
    "Define success metrics and acceptance criteria for each migration phase"
  ],
  "scope": "This assessment covers the migration of:\n\n**In-Scope Systems:**\n- SAP ERP (ECC 6.0) - 45 application servers, 8 database servers\n- Oracle Database 19c RAC - 4-node cluster\n- Custom integration middleware (MuleSoft) - 12 servers\n- File storage (NetApp NAS) - 180 TB\n- Batch processing systems - 8 dedicated servers\n- Development/QA environments - 20 servers\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n- Legacy mainframe interfaces (separate modernization project)\n- Desktop applications (VDI migration separate stream)\n- Third-party SaaS integrations (already cloud-native)\n\n**Timeline:** Assessment conducted August-October 2024. Migration window proposed January 2025 - June 2026.",
  "methodology": "Conducted comprehensive cloud migration assessment following AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP) methodology and AWS Well-Architected Framework:\n\n1. **Discovery & Assessment (4 weeks)**\n   - Application dependency mapping using AWS Application Discovery Service\n   - Performance baseline collection (CPU, memory, I/O, network)\n   - Licensing audit and cloud compatibility review\n   - Security and compliance requirements gathering\n\n2. **Architecture Design (6 weeks)**\n   - Target state architecture design (multi-account, multi-region)\n   - Network design (VPC, Transit Gateway, Direct Connect)\n   - Database migration strategy (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous)\n   - Disaster recovery and business continuity planning\n\n3. **TCO Analysis (2 weeks)**\n   - Current infrastructure cost modeling\n   - AWS cost estimation using AWS Pricing Calculator\n   - 3-year TCO comparison with sensitivity analysis\n\n4. **Risk Assessment (2 weeks)**\n   - Technical risk identification (compatibility, performance)\n   - Business risk analysis (downtime, data loss)\n   - Compliance and regulatory review (SOX, GDPR)",
  "findings": [
    "COMPATIBILITY: SAP ECC 6.0 is certified for AWS deployment on EC2 instances (r5.8xlarge recommended for production)",
    "PERFORMANCE: Current on-premises infrastructure is over-provisioned by 40% (avg CPU utilization 28%)",
    "COST SAVINGS: 3-year TCO shows 35% savings ($4.2M) with AWS Reserved Instances and Savings Plans",
    "NETWORK: Current MPLS bandwidth insufficient for cloud replication; recommend AWS Direct Connect 10 Gbps",
    "DATABASE: Oracle RAC not required in AWS; recommend RDS for Oracle Multi-AZ for HA/DR",
    "LICENSING: Bring-Your-Own-License (BYOL) for SAP and Oracle reduces AWS costs by 18%",
    "DISASTER RECOVERY: Current RTO 8hrs/RPO 4hrs can be improved to RTO 1hr/RPO 15min with AWS",
    "STORAGE: NetApp file shares can be migrated to Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP (180 TB)",
    "COMPLIANCE: AWS provides SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS compliance certifications required",
    "SKILLS GAP: IT team requires AWS training (Solutions Architect, SysOps Admin certifications)"
  ],
  "analysis": "**Migration Approach Recommendation: Rehost (Lift-and-Shift) with Selective Re-platforming**\n\nAfter evaluating the 6 R's of migration (Rehost, Replatform, Repurchase, Refactor, Retire, Retain), we recommend:\n\n1. **Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Non-Production Environments** - Migrate Dev/QA to AWS to establish foundation, validate tooling, and train team. Low risk, high learning value.\n\n2. **Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Production Database Re-platforming** - Migrate Oracle RAC to RDS for Oracle Multi-AZ. Eliminates RAC licensing costs ($400K/year) and improves DR capabilities.\n\n3. **Phase 3 (Months 13-18): Production Application Rehosting** - Migrate SAP application servers using CloudEndure or AWS MGN. Cutover during planned maintenance window with 4-hour rollback capability.\n\n**Cost Analysis:**\n\n| Cost Category | On-Premises (3-year) | AWS (3-year) | Savings |\n|---------------|---------------------|--------------|----------|\n| Hardware/Refresh | $5.2M | $0 | $5.2M |\n| Data Center | $2.8M | $0 | $2.8M |\n| Compute (EC2) | - | $3.1M | -$3.1M |\n| Database (RDS) | - | $1.8M | -$1.8M |\n| Storage (FSx) | - | $0.9M | -$0.9M |\n| Network (DX) | - | $0.6M | -$0.6M |\n| Licensing | $3.0M | $2.4M | $0.6M |\n| Operations | $3.2M | $1.8M | $1.4M |\n| **TOTAL** | **$14.2M** | **$10.0M** | **$4.2M (35%)** |\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n- Network bandwidth: Deploy Direct Connect 6 months before migration\n- Performance validation: Comprehensive testing in non-prod for 3 months\n- Rollback capability: Maintain on-premises for 90 days post-cutover\n- Skills gap: AWS training program for 20 team members ($150K investment)",
  "recommendations": [
    "APPROVE: Proceed with AWS migration using phased 18-month approach",
    "IMMEDIATE: Establish AWS Organization with multi-account Landing Zone (Control Tower)",
    "IMMEDIATE: Procure AWS Direct Connect 10 Gbps circuits to all data centers",
    "MONTH 1: Engage AWS Professional Services for MAP program enrollment",
    "MONTH 2: Conduct AWS training for 20 infrastructure team members (Solutions Architect, SysOps)",
    "MONTH 3: Deploy AWS Migration Hub and Application Discovery Service for dependency mapping",
    "MONTH 4-6: Migrate Dev/QA environments to AWS for validation and testing",
    "MONTH 7-12: Re-platform Oracle RAC to RDS Multi-AZ with Database Migration Service (DMS)",
    "MONTH 13-18: Rehost SAP application servers using AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)",
    "POST-MIGRATION: Implement FinOps practices with AWS Cost Explorer and Trusted Advisor",
    "ONGOING: Monthly TCO review and optimization (right-sizing, Reserved Instance management)"
  ],
  "conclusion": "Migration to AWS is technically feasible, financially justified, and strategically aligned with Global Manufacturing Corp's digital transformation goals. The recommended phased approach minimizes risk while delivering incremental value. Early migration of non-production environments builds team expertise before production cutover. Re-platforming the database eliminates expensive Oracle RAC licensing while improving DR capabilities. The 35% TCO reduction ($4.2M over 3 years) provides strong ROI justification, with additional benefits in agility, scalability, and innovation velocity.",
