# Screenshot Plan (Sanitized)

## Capture Targets
- Homepage (hero + category tiles) with anonymized branding.
- Product detail page showing variation selectors and pricing table with placeholder SKUs.
- Booking calendar page demonstrating availability states and rate breakdowns.
- Admin catalog import screen (staging) with blurred supplier names.
- Checkout confirmation page with masked order IDs.

## Redaction & Anonymization Steps
- Replace all logos/branding with neutral placeholders before capture.
- Mask order IDs, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, and payment references.
- Remove EXIF metadata from PNG exports.
- Store files in this folder using naming: `area-page-YYYYMMDD.png`.

## Status
Screenshots will be added after final validation; this README documents the planned, sanitized scope for reviewers.
