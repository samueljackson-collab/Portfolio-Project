# PRJ-WEB-001: Commercial E-commerce & Booking Systems

**Status:** üîÑ Recovery/Rebuild in Progress
**Category:** Web Development & Data Management
**Technologies:** WordPress, WooCommerce, PHP, SQL, JavaScript

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status

This project is undergoing **recovery and reconstruction** following data loss from a retired workstation. Original source code, automation scripts, and detailed documentation were not fully backed up before the system was decommissioned.

**What was lost:**
- Custom WordPress/WooCommerce plugins and themes
- SQL automation scripts for catalog management
- Content management workflows and runbooks
- Deployment automation and scripts
- Original project documentation and screenshots

**What's being recovered:**
- High-level architectural knowledge (in-memory)
- Database export snapshots (partial)
- Client-facing site screenshots (limited)
- Process knowledge and workflow patterns

## Original Project Overview

### Project Portfolio

Between 2015-2022, I designed, built, and managed multiple data-heavy commercial websites as a freelance web developer:

#### 1. **Resort Booking Website**
- Complex booking system with seasonal pricing
- Accommodation variations (room types, packages, add-ons)
- Calendar availability management
- Email automation for confirmations and reminders
- Integration with payment gateways

#### 2. **High-SKU Flooring Store**
- **10,000+ products** across multiple categories
- Weekly price updates via SQL import scripts
- Advanced filtering (material, color, size, brand)
- Bulk inventory management
- Product attribute synchronization

#### 3. **Tour Operator Website**
- Tours with complex variations (dates, group sizes, add-ons)
- Dynamic pricing based on occupancy and season
- Multi-day itinerary management
- Gallery and review integration
- Booking calendar with capacity limits

### Technical Highlights

#### Data Management at Scale
- Developed SQL scripts to automate weekly price updates across thousands of SKUs
- Prevented data inconsistencies with validation checks before import
- Used staging environments to test bulk updates before production deployment

#### Content & SEO Strategy
- Optimized product pages for search engines (meta descriptions, structured data)
- Implemented breadcrumb navigation for better UX and SEO
- Created content templates for consistent product descriptions

#### Performance Optimization
- Implemented caching strategies for large catalogs
- Optimized database queries to reduce page load times
- Used CDN for image delivery

#### Process Documentation
- Created runbooks for common operations (price updates, new product additions)
- Documented backup and restore procedures
- Established change control processes for production updates

## Recovery Plan

### Week 1: Catalog and Restore (Current Phase)
- [ ] Locate and extract data from backup exports
- [ ] Reconstruct database schema diagrams
- [ ] Document SQL workflow patterns from memory
- [ ] Identify recoverable code snippets or configuration files

### Week 2: Re-document Processes
- [ ] Recreate content management runbooks
- [ ] Document deployment procedures
- [ ] Rebuild automation script templates
- [ ] Capture architectural decisions and rationale

### Week 3: Publish Artifacts
- [ ] Create sanitized code examples (remove client-specific info)
- [ ] Write project narratives with before/after metrics
- [ ] Publish architecture diagrams
- [ ] Document lessons learned

## What Will Be Published

Once recovery is complete, this directory will contain:

### Documentation
- **Architecture Overview** - System design and component interaction
- **Data Workflows** - How catalog updates, bookings, and inventory were managed
- **Operational Runbooks** - Step-by-step procedures for common tasks
- **Lessons Learned** - What worked, what didn't, and what I'd do differently

### Code Examples (Sanitized)
- SQL scripts for bulk operations (anonymized)
- WordPress plugin snippets for custom functionality
- Automation examples for scheduled tasks
- API integration patterns

### Visual Evidence
- Architecture diagrams showing system components
- Database ERD (entity-relationship diagrams)
- Screenshots of admin interfaces (if available)
- Performance metrics and analytics data

### Case Studies
- Problem-solution narratives for key challenges
- Quantified outcomes (load time improvements, automation time savings)
- Client feedback and testimonials (with permission)

## Lessons from Data Loss

This experience taught valuable lessons about:

1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Version control for all custom code (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
   - Documentation in cloud storage (Google Drive, Notion, Confluence)
   - Regular backup verification and restore testing
   - Offsite and cloud backups for critical data

2. **Knowledge Preservation**
   - Document decisions and rationale as they happen
   - Maintain architecture diagrams throughout the project lifecycle
   - Use wikis or knowledge bases for operational procedures
   - Keep a project journal or log of significant changes

3. **Decommissioning Procedures**
   - Create a checklist for retiring systems
   - Perform final data extraction before wiping drives
   - Archive projects even if "no longer needed"
   - Assume you'll want it later

These are now core practices in my current work and homelab projects.
