# Enterprise Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview
Comprehensive disaster recovery (DR) strategy aligning business objectives with technical recovery capabilities. Covers readiness, response, and continual improvement for multi-region cloud workloads.

## Structure
- `plan/` – Master DR plan with RTO/RPO targets, decision trees, and communication templates.
- `runbooks/` – Service-specific recovery procedures referencing individual project runbooks.
- `exercises/` – Tabletop and failover exercise scripts with retrospectives.
- `evidence/` – Compliance artifacts, test results, and sign-off forms.

## Key Elements
- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** Maps critical services to recovery tiers.
- **Recovery Strategies:** Active-active, pilot light, warm standby, and backup/restore options for each workload.
- **Data Protection:** Backup cadence, retention policies, and verification steps.
- **Communication Plan:** Stakeholder matrix, escalation ladder, status update cadence.
- **Testing Program:** Quarterly game days, annual full failover with metrics tracking.

## Usage
1. Review BIA to understand service criticality.
2. Follow runbooks for simulated or real incidents, documenting timelines and outcomes.
3. Update plan after architecture changes or post-incident retrospectives.
4. Store signed approvals and audit reports under `evidence/`.

## Integration
- Ties into security posture scanner findings to prioritize remediation.
- Provides inputs to deployment guide for release readiness criteria.
- Aligns with architecture doc for dependency mapping.
