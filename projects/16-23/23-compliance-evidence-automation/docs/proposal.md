- Provide reviewers with dashboards tracking control status and exceptions.
- Generate auditor-ready packages with tamper-evident storage and access logs.

## Success Criteria
- 80% of recurring evidence requests satisfied automatically.
- Exception handling workflow resolves outstanding issues within five business days.
- Auditors accept automated packages without additional manual screenshots.
