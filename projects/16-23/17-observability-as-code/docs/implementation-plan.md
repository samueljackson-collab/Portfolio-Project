# Implementation Plan

## Phases & Milestones
- **Phase 1: Baseline Modules (4 weeks):**
  - Define metrics/logging/tracing Terraform modules with defaults for staging and production.
  - Integrate static analysis to check SLO coverage and alert severity.
  - Publish sample service repository using the modules.
- **Phase 2: Policy + Automation (3 weeks):**
  - Deploy policy engine with required tags, runbook links, and escalation info.
  - Wire modules into CI/CD pipeline with preview plans and automated approvals.
  - Create dashboards with dynamic service catalogs pulling metadata from Git.
- **Phase 3: Enablement (4 weeks):**
  - Deliver enablement workshops and office hours for service teams.
  - Collect feedback loops and iterate on module ergonomics.
  - Expand coverage to include synthetic monitoring and RUM.

## Backlog Candidates
- Support multi-cloud observability targets with provider-agnostic abstractions.
- Add golden queries library for tiered alerting patterns.
- Automate onboarding reports for compliance reviews.
