# Proposal

## Problem Statement
Every team provisions monitoring manually, leading to inconsistent coverage, missing alerts, and painful onboarding for new services.

## Goals
- Codify dashboards, alerts, and telemetry pipelines using reusable modules.
- Enforce baseline SLO instrumentation across all services.
- Provide self-service documentation and CI linting for observability configurations.

## Success Criteria
- All Tier 1 services managed via observability modules within two quarters.
- Failed lint jobs for misconfigured alerts block deployments by default.
- New service onboarding to production telemetry takes under one day.
