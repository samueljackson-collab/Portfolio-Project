# Architecture

## Overview
Infrastructure-as-code pipelines orchestrate telemetry collectors, storage backends, and dashboards with policy enforcement.

## Component Breakdown
- **Terraform Modules:** Provision metrics, logs, and tracing infrastructure with opinionated defaults.
- **Policy Engine:** Validates configurations against organizational guardrails before apply.
- **Telemetry Collectors:** Agent and sidecar deployments shipping data to central backends.
- **Developer Portal:** Publishes module documentation, quickstarts, and examples.
