# Architecture

## Overview
Zero-trust brokers validate identity, device, and context before granting session tokens to application gateways.

## Component Breakdown
- **Identity Provider:** Centralizes SSO, MFA, and adaptive risk scoring.
- **Device Posture Service:** Validates OS patch level, disk encryption, and endpoint protection.
- **Access Gateway:** Proxies authenticated traffic to internal web, SSH, and RDP services.
- **Audit Pipeline:** Streams session metadata and recordings to SIEM for monitoring.
