# Proposal

## Problem Statement
Legacy VPN concentrators are overloaded, lack granular access policies, and provide minimal visibility into session activity.

## Goals
- Implement identity-aware proxies with per-application access policies.
- Enforce device posture checks before granting access to sensitive resources.
- Provide unified auditing and session recording for critical systems.

## Success Criteria
- All remote admin access flows through zero-trust gateways with MFA enforced.
- Device posture compliance above 98% across remote workforce.
- Security operations receives real-time alerts for anomalous session behavior.
