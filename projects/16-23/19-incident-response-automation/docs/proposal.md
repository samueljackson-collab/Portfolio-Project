# Proposal

## Problem Statement
On-call engineers juggle multiple tools manually, causing slow triage, missed context, and inconsistent stakeholder communication.

## Goals
- Automate enrichment workflows pulling runbook links, dashboards, and recent deploys into incident channels.
- Provide guided remediation playbooks with decision trees for common failure modes.
- Instrument incident metrics with MTTA/MTTR reporting for leadership reviews.

## Success Criteria
- Median time from alert to engaged responders under five minutes.
- Automated incident channel creation with enriched context in under 60 seconds.
- Quarterly retrospectives include data-driven insights with less than 5% manual data correction.
