# Architecture

## Overview
Event-driven automations integrate paging, collaboration, and observability platforms to guide responders end-to-end.

## Component Breakdown
- **Event Listener:** Subscribes to critical alerts and opens incidents via incident management platform.
- **Enrichment Service:** Pulls deployment history, impacted services, and runbook references.
- **Collaboration Bot:** Creates channels, invites roles, and posts checklists.
- **Analytics Store:** Captures incident timeline events and metrics for reporting.
