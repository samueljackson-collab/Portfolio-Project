# Proposal

## Problem Statement
Teams struggle to keep documentation updated, resulting in stale runbooks and knowledge silos that slow onboarding and incident response.

## Goals
- Generate first-draft documentation from code repositories and issue trackers.
- Enable reviewers to approve, edit, or reject AI-suggested changes with audit trails.
- Integrate with documentation portals to surface freshness indicators.

## Success Criteria
- Reduce time to produce post-incident reports by 50%.
- Automated doc refresh suggestions generated weekly for all Tier 1 services.
- Maintain reviewer approval accuracy above 95%.
