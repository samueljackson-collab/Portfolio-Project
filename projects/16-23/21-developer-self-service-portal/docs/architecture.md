# Architecture

## Overview
Event-driven workflows backed by service catalog and policy engines deliver resources via infrastructure APIs and surface docs in the portal.

## Component Breakdown
- **Service Catalog:** Tracks golden path templates, resource metadata, and ownership.
- **Workflow Engine:** Executes provisioning pipelines with approval logic.
- **UI Portal:** Provides intuitive interface, search, and status tracking.
- **Integration Hub:** Connects to CI/CD, secrets management, and documentation repositories.
