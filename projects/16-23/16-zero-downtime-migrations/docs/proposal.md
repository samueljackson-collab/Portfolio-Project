# Proposal

## Problem Statement
Critical microservices still require maintenance windows for database and API migrations, causing revenue-impacting downtime and forcing off-hours releases.

## Goals
- Design blue/green friendly workflows for schema and API version changes.
- Introduce automated pre-flight validation and shadow traffic testing before cutovers.
- Create reusable runbooks, metrics, and alerts for every migration class.

## Success Criteria
- Migrations complete with zero customer-facing errors and under 60 seconds of read-only mode.
- Rollback executes within five minutes with full data consistency checks.
- Teams self-serve migration playbooks for new services within two sprints of onboarding.
