# Architecture

## Overview
A centralized orchestrator coordinates migration steps, guarded by validation services and observability hooks to guarantee safe rollouts.

## Component Breakdown
- **Migration Orchestrator:** Manages workflows, approvals, and sequencing for schema and API changes.
- **Traffic Shaper:** Routes production requests between blue/green environments and controls read-only windows.
- **Shadow Validator:** Mirrors live traffic to new versions and compares outputs for regressions.
- **Observability Dashboard:** Aggregates metrics, traces, and logs into migration-specific views.
