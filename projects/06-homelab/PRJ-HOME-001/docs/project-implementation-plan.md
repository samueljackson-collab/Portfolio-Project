# Project Implementation Plan
**Project:** PRJ-HOME-001 – UniFi Home Network Refresh  \
**Duration:** 4 Weeks

---

## 1. Phase Overview
| Phase | Duration | Objectives | Key Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 – Planning & Design | Week 1 | Validate requirements, finalize topology/IP plan | Approved design package, BOM, risk register |
| Phase 2 – Infrastructure Prep | Week 2 | Ready physical environment and staging configs | Rack installed, bench-tested configs, labeled cabling |
| Phase 3 – Deployment | Week 3 | Install hardware, configure network & wireless | Operational network, adopted APs/cameras, validation results |
| Phase 4 – Optimization & Handoff | Week 4 | Tune performance, complete documentation | RF tuning report, monitoring dashboards, runbooks delivered |

## 2. Detailed Task Breakdown
### Phase 1 – Planning & Design
- Conduct virtual walkthrough of floor plan; confirm AP placement with homeowner.
- Produce network design, topology diagram, and IP plan (see associated docs).
- Review security requirements; draft firewall matrix.
- Obtain stakeholder approval and budget sign-off.

### Phase 2 – Infrastructure Prep
- Install rack, UPS, and cable management hardware.
- Pull structured cabling and terminate patch panel.
- Stage UDM-Pro, switches, APs, and Protect system in lab; apply baseline configs.
- Update documentation with serial numbers and photos.

### Phase 3 – Deployment
- Mount indoor/outdoor APs, cameras, and flood lights per design.
- Connect and label all patch cords; verify PoE loads.
- Restore staged configurations on-site; integrate with ISP modem.
- Execute validation testing (VLAN isolation, throughput, coverage, recording).

### Phase 4 – Optimization & Handoff
- Analyze RF survey results; adjust transmit power/channel plans.
- Configure monitoring dashboards and alerting thresholds.
- Deliver documentation set (design, runbooks, DR plan, policies) to homeowner.
- Conduct knowledge transfer session; review operations cadence.

## 3. Dependencies & Assumptions
- ISP fiber handoff active prior to Week 3.
- Weather permitting for outdoor installs.
- Homeowner available for access during maintenance windows.

## 4. Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Weather delays for outdoor cabling | Prepare temporary wireless bridge fallback |
| Equipment lead time | Order hardware immediately after approval; keep spare AP/camera |
| Unexpected wall construction | Use surface-mount raceways and aesthetic covers |
| Firmware regressions | Stage upgrades in lab; maintain ability to downgrade |

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
- All SSIDs broadcast with documented VLAN mapping.
- Cameras and flood lights online with continuous recording verified.
- Monitoring dashboard active with baseline metrics logged.
- Change log updated with implementation summary and evidence.

## 6. Post-Implementation Review
- Schedule review meeting 1 week after completion to gather feedback.
- Track outstanding punch list items to closure.
- Archive project artifacts and transition to steady-state operations (monthly maintenance cadence).
