# Homelab Build Photos (Sanitized)

These photo notes document the homelab build without exposing sensitive identifiers. Original images have EXIF stripped and file names generalized.

| ap-mounts.png | Ceiling/ceiling tile mounts for three APs with coverage annotations. | Location markers generalized to room names. |
