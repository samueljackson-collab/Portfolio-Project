A fully styled mockup of the Wiki.js documentation interface showcasing the homelab infrastructure overview. This HTML file demonstrates:

- **UI/UX Design**: Complete Wiki.js interface with header, navigation, content area, and table of contents
- **Content Structure**: Comprehensive documentation of hardware, network architecture, VMs, and services
- **Information Architecture**: Well-organized sections covering:
  - Hardware specifications (Proxmox host, TrueNAS storage)
  - Network architecture (VLAN segmentation)
  - Virtual machine inventory and resource allocation
  - Service architecture principles
  - Backup strategy
  - Monitoring & observability stack

**Purpose**: This mockup serves as both a visual reference for the actual Wiki.js deployment and as portfolio evidence of documentation design and technical writing capabilities.
