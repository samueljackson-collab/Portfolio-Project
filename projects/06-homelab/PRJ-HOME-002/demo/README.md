# PRJ-HOME-002 Demo Files

This directory contains visual mockups and demonstrations of the homelab infrastructure and services.

## Files

### wiki-infrastructure-overview.html
A fully styled mockup of the Wiki.js documentation interface showcasing the homelab infrastructure overview. This HTML file demonstrates:

- **UI/UX Design**: Complete Wiki.js interface with header, navigation, content area, and table of contents
- **Content Structure**: Comprehensive documentation of hardware, network architecture, VMs, and services
- **Information Architecture**: Well-organized sections covering:
  - Hardware specifications (Proxmox host, TrueNAS storage)
  - Network architecture (VLAN segmentation)
  - Virtual machine inventory and resource allocation
  - Service architecture principles
  - Backup strategy
  - Monitoring & observability stack

**Purpose**: This mockup serves as both a visual reference for the actual Wiki.js deployment and as portfolio evidence of documentation design and technical writing capabilities.

**To View**: Open `wiki-infrastructure-overview.html` in any web browser.

### home-assistant-dashboard.html
A fully interactive mockup of a Home Assistant smart home dashboard. This HTML file demonstrates:

- **Modern UI Design**: Clean, responsive card-based layout with gradient backgrounds and smooth animations
- **Interactive Components**: Functional toggles, buttons, and controls with real-time state management
- **Dashboard Features**:
  - Quick action buttons for common automations
  - Climate control with temperature adjustment
  - Light management with on/off toggles
  - Security monitoring (door locks, motion sensors)
  - Energy usage visualization with bar charts
  - Media player controls
  - Homelab service status monitoring (Proxmox, TrueNAS, PostgreSQL)
- **Design Patterns**: Card-based UI, sticky header navigation, status indicators, and hover effects

**Purpose**: Demonstrates Home Assistant integration in the homelab environment and showcases front-end development skills with modern CSS techniques (gradients, backdrop-filter, transitions, grid/flexbox layouts).

**Live Demo**: Available as a React component at `/home-assistant` route in the portfolio frontend.

**To View**: Open `home-assistant-dashboard.html` in any web browser.
