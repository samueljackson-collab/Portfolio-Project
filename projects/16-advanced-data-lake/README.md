# Project 16: Advanced Data Lake & Analytics

## Documentation
For cross-project documentation, standards, and runbooks, see the [Portfolio Documentation Hub](../../DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md).


## 📊 Portfolio Status Board

🟢 Done · 🟠 In Progress · 🔵 Planned

**Current Status:** 🟢 Done (Implemented)


## Overview
Implements a medallion architecture on Databricks with Delta Lake, structured streaming, and dbt transformations.

## Workflow
1. Bronze layer ingests raw JSON from Kafka topics.
2. Silver layer applies cleansing and joins with dimension tables.
3. Gold layer exposes star schema to BI tools with Delta Live Tables.

## Local Testing
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/bronze_to_silver.py --input data/bronze.json --output silver.parquet
```


## Code Generation Prompts

This section contains AI-assisted code generation prompts that can help you recreate or extend project components. These prompts are designed to work with AI coding assistants like Claude, GPT-4, or GitHub Copilot.

### Data Pipelines

#### 1. ETL Pipeline
```
Create a Python-based ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow that extracts data from PostgreSQL, transforms it with pandas, and loads it into a data warehouse with incremental updates
```

#### 2. Stream Processing
```
Generate a Kafka consumer in Python that processes real-time events, performs aggregations using sliding windows, and stores results in Redis with TTL
```

#### 3. Data Quality
```
Write a data validation framework that checks for schema compliance, null values, data freshness, and statistical anomalies, with alerting on failures
```

### How to Use These Prompts

1. **Copy the prompt** from the code block above
2. **Customize placeholders** (replace [bracketed items] with your specific requirements)
3. **Provide context** to your AI assistant about:
   - Your development environment and tech stack
   - Existing code patterns and conventions in this project
   - Any constraints or requirements specific to your use case
4. **Review and adapt** the generated code before using it
5. **Test thoroughly** and adjust as needed for your specific scenario

### Best Practices

- Always review AI-generated code for security vulnerabilities
- Ensure generated code follows your project's coding standards
- Add appropriate error handling and logging
- Write tests for AI-generated components
- Document any assumptions or limitations
- Keep sensitive information (credentials, keys) in environment variables
