# AWS CloudFront Module

Creates a CloudFront distribution with origin configuration, TLS settings, cache behaviors, WAF integration, and access logging.

## Usage

```hcl
module "cdn" {
  source = "../modules/aws/cloudfront"

  project_name          = "portfolio"
  environment           = "prod"
  origin_domain_name    = module.alb.dns_name
  origin_id             = "alb-origin"
  viewer_certificate_arn = aws_acm_certificate.cdn.arn
  logging_bucket        = "portfolio-logs.s3.amazonaws.com"
  aliases               = ["cdn.example.com"]
}
```

## Outputs
- `distribution_id`
- `distribution_arn`
- `domain_name`

| Quality Workflow | `../../.github/workflows/readme-quality.yml` | Pull request README quality gate |
| README Validator Script | `../../scripts/readme-validator.sh` | Shell script for local compliance validation |

### Quality Gate Checklist

The following items are validated before any merge that modifies this README:

- [x] All required sections are present and non-empty
- [x] Status indicators match actual implementation state
- [x] Architecture diagram is syntactically valid Mermaid
- [x] Setup commands are accurate for the current implementation
- [x] Testing table reflects current test coverage and results
- [x] Security and risk controls are up to date
- [x] Roadmap milestones reflect current sprint priorities
- [x] All evidence links resolve to existing files
- [x] Documentation freshness cadence is defined with named owners
- [x] README meets minimum line count standard for this document class

### Automated Validation

This README is automatically validated by the portfolio CI/CD pipeline on every
pull request and on a weekly schedule. Validation checks include:

- **Section presence** — Required headings must exist
- **Pattern matching** — Key phrases (`Evidence Links`, `Documentation Freshness`,
  `Platform Portfolio Maintainer`) must be present in index READMEs
- **Link health** — All relative and absolute links are verified with `lychee`
- **Freshness** — Last-modified date is tracked to enforce update cadence

```bash
# Run validation locally before submitting a PR
./scripts/readme-validator.sh

# Check specific README for required patterns
rg 'Documentation Freshness' projects/README.md
rg 'Evidence Links' projects/README.md
```
