# Project 22: Autonomous DevOps Platform

**Category:** Infrastructure & DevOps
**Status:** 🟡 40% Complete
**Source:** [View Code](https://github.com/samueljackson-collab/Portfolio-Project/tree/main/projects/22-autonomous-devops)

## Overview

Event-driven automation layer that reacts to telemetry, triggers remediation workflows, and coordinates incident response using **Runbooks-as-Code**. Implements self-healing infrastructure with AI-assisted decision making and automated remediation.

## Key Features

- **Event-Driven Automation** - React to metrics, logs, and alerts in real-time
- **Runbooks-as-Code** - Version-controlled automation playbooks
- **Self-Healing** - Automatic remediation without human intervention
- **AI Decision Engine** - ML-based incident classification and routing
- **Audit Trail** - Complete logging of all automated actions

## Architecture

        Remediation                   Notification
        Actions:                      (PagerDuty, Slack)
        - Scale pods
        - Restart services
        - Clear caches
        - Rotate credentials
              ↓
        Audit Log (Elasticsearch)
```

**Automation Flow:**
1. **Monitoring**: Collect metrics, logs, traces
2. **Detection**: Pattern matching and anomaly detection
3. **Classification**: AI categorizes incident type and severity
4. **Selection**: Choose appropriate runbook
5. **Execution**: Run automated remediation steps
6. **Verification**: Confirm issue resolved
7. **Escalation**: Alert humans if automation fails

## Technologies

- **Python** - Core automation engine
- **Prometheus** - Metrics collection
- **Elasticsearch** - Log aggregation and search
- **Temporal** - Workflow orchestration
- **scikit-learn** - ML for incident classification
- **Ansible** - Infrastructure automation
- **Kubernetes API** - Container orchestration
- **AWS Systems Manager** - Cloud automation
- **Slack/PagerDuty** - Notification integrations

## Quick Start

```bash
cd projects/22-autonomous-devops

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure event sources
export PROMETHEUS_URL="http://prometheus:9090"
export ELASTICSEARCH_URL="http://elasticsearch:9200"

# Run autonomous engine
python src/autonomous_engine.py

# Test with sample event
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "high_cpu", "severity": "critical", "pod": "app-123"}'

# Execute specific runbook
python src/autonomous_engine.py \
  --runbook runbooks/scale-deployment.yaml \
  --params '{"deployment": "myapp", "replicas": 5}'
```
