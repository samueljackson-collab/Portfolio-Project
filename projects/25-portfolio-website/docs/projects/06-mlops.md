# Project 6: MLOps Platform

**Category:** Machine Learning & AI
**Status:** 🟢 60% Complete
**Source:** [View Code](https://github.com/samueljackson-collab/Portfolio-Project/tree/main/projects/6-mlops-platform)

## Overview

End-to-end MLOps workflow for training, evaluating, registering, and deploying machine learning models. Combines **MLflow** for experiment tracking, **Optuna** for automated hyperparameter tuning, and modular deployment targeting Kubernetes, AWS Lambda, or Amazon SageMaker.

## Key Features

- **Experiment Tracking** - MLflow integration for metrics, parameters, and artifacts
- **AutoML Optimization** - Optuna-powered hyperparameter search
- **Model Registry** - Versioned model storage with promotion workflows
- **Multi-Platform Deployment** - Kubernetes, Lambda, and SageMaker support
- **Drift Monitoring** - Automated model performance tracking and retraining triggers

## Architecture

                    Monitoring & Drift Detection

                    Retraining Pipeline (Triggered)
```

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Data Ingestion**: Load training data from S3, databases, or data lakes
2. **Preprocessing**: Feature engineering, scaling, encoding
3. **Training**: Model training with experiment logging
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optuna optimization trials
5. **Evaluation**: Metrics calculation and model comparison
6. **Registry**: Promote best models to staging/production
7. **Deployment**: Containerized serving or serverless inference
8. **Monitoring**: Performance metrics and drift detection

## Technologies

- **Python** - Core implementation language
- **MLflow** - Experiment tracking and model registry
- **Optuna** - Hyperparameter optimization
