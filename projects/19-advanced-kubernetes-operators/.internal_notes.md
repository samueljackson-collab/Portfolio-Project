# Internal Notes for Advanced Kubernetes Operators

This file retains the longer-form AI-generated explanation that previously lived in the module
docstring. Keep it private (e.g., excluded from published documentation) and update it as the
implementation evolves.

"""Advanced Kubernetes operator framework with auto-healing helpers.

This module provides a lightweight, Python-based implementation of the
operators that are described in the accompanying project documentation.
The goal is to offer a realistic reference implementation that can be run
inside a Kubernetes cluster (for example with the Kubernetes Python client)
while still remaining approachable for local experimentation.

The code below intentionally favours clarity over raw performance.  It uses
periodic reconciliation loops instead of the lower level watch streams so it
can operate in both in-cluster and out-of-cluster environments without
additional threading complexity.  Each operator keeps track of the custom
resources it owns and continuously drives the actual state of the cluster
towards the desired state expressed in the CR specification.

Note: Running this module requires access to a Kubernetes cluster and the
``kubernetes`` Python client library.  The module is designed so that it can
be unit-tested locally by mocking the ``client`` objects if a real cluster is
not available.
