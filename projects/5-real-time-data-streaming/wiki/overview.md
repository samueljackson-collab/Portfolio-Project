# Project 5: Real-time Data Streaming
> **Category:** Data Engineering | **Status:** 🟡 40% Complete
> **Source:** projects/25-portfolio-website/docs/projects/05-streaming.md

## 📋 Executive Summary

Event-driven streaming platform built on **Apache Kafka** and **Apache Flink** for processing portfolio events with exactly-once semantics. Enables real-time analytics, event sourcing, and decoupled microservices communication at scale.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Exactly-Once Processing** - Guaranteed event delivery without duplicates
- **Event Sourcing** - Immutable event log as source of truth
- **Stream Processing** - Real-time transformations with Apache Flink
- **Scalable Architecture** - Kafka partitioning for horizontal scaling
- **Schema Registry** - Avro schemas for data consistency

## 🏗️ Architecture

> Source: ../../../projects/25-portfolio-website/docs/projects/05-streaming.md#architecture
```
Event Producers → Kafka Topics → Flink Processing Jobs → Output Sinks
                      ↓                   ↓
                Schema Registry    State Checkpoints
                      ↓                   ↓
              Avro Validation      Exactly-Once Guarantees
```

**Data Flow:**
1. **Ingestion**: Producers publish events to Kafka topics
2. **Validation**: Schema Registry validates Avro payloads
3. **Processing**: Flink jobs consume, transform, aggregate events
4. **Windowing**: Time-based and count-based windows for analytics
5. **Sinks**: Results written to databases, data lakes, or downstream topics

### Components

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Apache Kafka | Apache Kafka | Distributed event streaming platform |
| Apache Flink | Apache Flink | Stream processing framework |
| Python | Python | Event processing logic and orchestration |

### Decision 1: Adopt Apache Kafka
**Context:** Project 5: Real-time Data Streaming requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** Distributed event streaming platform
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

### Decision 2: Adopt Apache Flink
**Context:** Project 5: Real-time Data Streaming requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** Stream processing framework
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

### Decision 3: Adopt Python
**Context:** Project 5: Real-time Data Streaming requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** Event processing logic and orchestration
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

```bash
cd projects/5-real-time-streaming

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Kafka and Flink (local simulation)
docker-compose up -d

# Run event processor
python src/process_events.py

# Produce sample events
python src/event_producer.py --events 1000 --rate 100/sec
```
