# Advanced Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering Lab

## Documentation
For cross-project documentation, standards, and runbooks, see the [Portfolio Documentation Hub](../../DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md).


Simulated static/dynamic analysis with heuristic YARA generation, JWT-protected analysis actions, and a React lab view.

## Highlights
- FastAPI `MalwareSample` and `AnalysisReport` models with an `/analyze` endpoint that synthesizes static, dynamic, IOC, and YARA outputs.
- Analysis logic includes hash-prefix heuristics for packer detection and family hints, documented in code comments.
- React UI shows sample metadata, IOC/YARA outputs, and differentiates unanalyzed samples.

## API Overview
- `POST /malware/samples` (auth) — register a sample with name/hash/type.
- `POST /malware/samples/{id}/analyze` (auth) — run simulated static/dynamic analysis and mark status to `analyzed`.
- `GET /malware/samples/{id}` — retrieve sample details and report.
- `GET /malware/yara` — list generated YARA rules.

## Heuristic Logic
- Hash prefixes imply packer use and seed IOC domains.
- Sample names hint at families (e.g., names containing "lock" become `ransom`).
- YARA rules are deterministic and copy-friendly for labs.

## Usage
1. Create a sample (`locker`, `ff11aa22`, type `pe`).
2. Call `/analyze` to produce simulated telemetry and YARA output.
3. View results in the Security Simulators page (Malware Analysis card).

## Running
- Backend: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` in `backend/`.
- Frontend: `npm run dev` in `frontend/`.
- Tests: `pytest backend/tests/test_security_simulators.py` and `npm run test` for component coverage.
