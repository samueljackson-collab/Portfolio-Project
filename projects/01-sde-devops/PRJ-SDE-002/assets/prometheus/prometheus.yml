# Prometheus configuration for the homelab observability stack
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# This file defines global scraping settings, scrape jobs for all monitored
# components, rule file locations, and alerting endpoints. The extensive
# comments explain why each option is chosen for the Proxmox-based homelab.

global:
  # Scrape all targets every 15 seconds to capture fine-grained metrics
  # while balancing resource usage on the small homelab environment.
  scrape_interval: 15s
  # Evaluate alerting and recording rules at the same cadence as scraping so
  # the latest data is always used for alert calculations.
  evaluation_interval: 15s
  # Global labels added to every time series. These make it easy to filter all
  # data from this homelab cluster when federating or aggregating metrics.
