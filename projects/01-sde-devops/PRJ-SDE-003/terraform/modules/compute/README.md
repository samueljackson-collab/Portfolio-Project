# Compute Module

Scaffolding for the web and application tier, including launch templates, Auto Scaling groups, target groups, and ALB integration. The inputs mirror VPC outputs so the module can be wired into each environment cleanly.

> Implementation note: resources are intentionally stubbed; extend this module with AMI selection, user-data bootstrap, health checks, and scaling policies tailored to your workloads.
