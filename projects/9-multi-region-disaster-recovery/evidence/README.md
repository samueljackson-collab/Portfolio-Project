# Evidence Bundle - Multi-Region DR

This directory contains deployment evidence, failover drill notes, and DR metrics for Project 9.

## Contents
- `deployment-log.md` – Terraform deployment attempt log (Terraform CLI unavailable in this environment).
- `failover-drill.md` – Simulated failover drill timeline, recovery steps, and RPO/RTO summary.
- `rpo-rto-metrics.csv` – Raw RPO/RTO timing data used for reporting.
- `regional-resource-inventory.csv` – Simulated inventory of primary/DR resources.

## Notes
- Evidence is marked **simulated** because live AWS access and Terraform CLI were not available in this execution environment.
