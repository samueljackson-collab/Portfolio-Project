# Project 13: Advanced Cybersecurity Platform
> **Category:** Security & Compliance | **Status:** 🟡 45% Complete
> **Source:** projects/25-portfolio-website/docs/projects/13-cybersecurity.md

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Security Orchestration and Automated Response (SOAR)** engine that consolidates SIEM alerts, enriches them with threat intelligence, and executes automated playbooks. Integrates with VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, and internal CMDB for comprehensive threat analysis.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Alert Consolidation** - Aggregates events from multiple SIEM sources
- **Threat Enrichment** - Automatic lookup with VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, MISP
- **Risk Scoring** - ML-based scoring accounting for asset criticality
- **Automated Response** - Playbooks for isolation, credential rotation, ticketing
- **Incident Tracking** - Full audit trail of investigations and actions

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
SIEM Sources → Alert Aggregator → SOAR Engine
(Splunk, QRadar,                      ↓
 Elastic SIEM)              ┌─── Enrichment ───┐
                            ↓                   ↓
                      VirusTotal          AbuseIPDB
                            ↓                   ↓
                        Risk Scoring Engine
                            ↓
                    ┌─── Playbook Router ───┐
                    ↓                        ↓
             High Risk (Auto)        Medium Risk (Manual)
                    ↓                        ↓
         ┌──────────┴─────────┐         Ticketing
    Isolate    Rotate      Block         (Jira)
   (Firewall) (Vault)     (EDR)
```

**Response Workflow:**
1. **Ingestion**: Alerts pulled from SIEMs via API
2. **Deduplication**: Similar alerts grouped
3. **Enrichment**: External threat intel lookup
4. **Scoring**: Risk calculation based on multiple factors
5. **Playbook Selection**: Automated response based on risk level
6. **Execution**: Actions triggered (isolation, rotation, etc.)
7. **Notification**: SOC team alerted with context

### Components

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Python | Python | Core SOAR engine |
| VirusTotal API | VirusTotal API | File/URL/IP reputation |
| AbuseIPDB | AbuseIPDB | IP abuse intelligence |

## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Adopt Python
**Context:** Project 13: Advanced Cybersecurity Platform requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** Core SOAR engine
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

### Decision 2: Adopt VirusTotal API
**Context:** Project 13: Advanced Cybersecurity Platform requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** File/URL/IP reputation
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

### Decision 3: Adopt AbuseIPDB
**Context:** Project 13: Advanced Cybersecurity Platform requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** IP abuse intelligence
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

```bash
cd projects/13-cybersecurity

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set API keys
export VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="your_key"
export ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY="your_key"

# Run SOAR engine with sample alerts
python src/soar_engine.py --alerts data/alerts.json

# Real-time SIEM integration
python src/soar_engine.py \
  --siem-endpoint https://splunk.example.com \
  --mode realtime

# Test playbook execution (dry-run)
python src/soar_engine.py --alerts data/alerts.json --dry-run
```

| **Enrichment success rate** | > 95% | Successfully enriched alerts / total alerts |
| **Playbook execution time** | < 5 minutes | Time from trigger → completion |
| **False positive rate** | < 10% | False positives / total alerts |
| **Response action success** | > 99% | Successful automations / total actions |
| **Mean time to respond (MTTR)** | < 15 minutes | Alert time → remediation complete |
