# Homelab & Secure Network Build

## Overview
Hands-on lab environment with rack-mounted gear, UniFi networking, and VPN access hardened to mirror production controls. The project captures the physical and logical network design, VLAN segmentation strategy, and Wi-Fi security posture.

## Current Deliverables
- High-level architecture description covering rack layout, switching, and firewall zones.
- Notes on VLAN assignments and how devices transition between wired and wireless segments.
- Checklist for provisioning new services safely on the homelab network.

## Upcoming Artifacts
- Redacted diagrams illustrating rack wiring, UniFi network topology, and VPN flow.
