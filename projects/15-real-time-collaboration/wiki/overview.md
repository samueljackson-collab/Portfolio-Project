# Project 15: Real-time Collaborative Platform
> **Category:** Web Applications | **Status:** 🟡 50% Complete
> **Source:** projects/25-portfolio-website/docs/projects/15-collaboration.md

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Operational Transform (OT)** collaboration server enabling low-latency document editing with **CRDT** backup for offline resilience. Provides Google Docs-like collaborative editing with conflict resolution, presence tracking, and real-time synchronization.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Real-time Editing** - Sub-100ms synchronization between clients
- **Operational Transform** - Conflict-free concurrent editing
- **CRDT Fallback** - Offline-first with conflict-free merging
- **Presence Tracking** - See who's viewing/editing in real-time
- **JWT Authentication** - Secure session management

## 🏗️ Architecture

> Source: ../../../projects/25-portfolio-website/docs/projects/15-collaboration.md#architecture
```
Client A ──┐                    ┌── Client B
           ↓                    ↓
      WebSocket Gateway (FastAPI)
               ↓
       ┌─── OT Engine ───┐
       ↓                 ↓
  Transform Queue    CRDT Store
       ↓                 ↓
   Document State   Conflict Resolution
       ↓                 ↓
   Redis (Cache) ← PostgreSQL (Persistent)
```

**Collaboration Flow:**
1. **Connection**: Client connects via WebSocket with JWT token
2. **Initialization**: Server sends current document state
3. **Edit**: Client sends operation (insert, delete, format)
4. **Transform**: OT engine transforms operation against concurrent edits
5. **Broadcast**: Transformed operation sent to all connected clients
6. **Apply**: Clients apply operation to local state
7. **Offline**: CRDT reconciles changes when client reconnects

### Components

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Python | Python | Backend implementation |
| FastAPI | FastAPI | WebSocket server framework |
| JWT | JWT | Authentication and authorization |

## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Adopt Python
**Context:** Project 15: Real-time Collaborative Platform requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** Backend implementation
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

### Decision 2: Adopt FastAPI
**Context:** Project 15: Real-time Collaborative Platform requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** WebSocket server framework
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

### Decision 3: Adopt JWT
**Context:** Project 15: Real-time Collaborative Platform requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** Authentication and authorization
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

```bash
cd projects/15-real-time-collaboration

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Redis and PostgreSQL
docker-compose up -d

# Run collaboration server
python src/collaboration_server.py --port 8080

# Test with WebSocket client
wscat -c ws://localhost:8080/collab?token=<JWT>

# Send edit operation
{"type": "insert", "pos": 10, "text": "Hello"}
```
