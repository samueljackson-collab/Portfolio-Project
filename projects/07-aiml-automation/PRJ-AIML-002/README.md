# PRJ-AIML-002 · AI/ML Marketing Automation Rollout

## Project Overview
PRJ-AIML-002 advances the automation foundation for always-on marketing workflows. The intent is to pair search-intent discovery with AI-assisted content operations and outreach automation so that marketing teams can deliver refreshed assets on a predictable cadence without increasing manual toil. The effort operates as a three-week sprint with discrete discovery, build, and launch phases.

## Objectives & Success Criteria
- Baseline technical SEO and analytics posture to surface the most pressing crawl, indexing, and performance gaps.
- Stand up repeatable AI/ML content workflows that can be executed by marketing operators with low friction and high transparency.
- Automate distribution and reporting so performance feedback loops remain under one week.
- Deliver a documented, supportable process stack with clear handoff to operations.

## Tooling & Automation Stack

### Re-plan & Escalation Guidance
If a dependency slips, first assess whether the impacted task can swap with a later activity in the same phase that does **not** rely on the blocked deliverable. Weekend buffer days (6–7, 13–14, 20–21) are the preferred swap targets; document the change in the project plan and ensure owners stay within phase boundaries. When swaps cannot resolve the risk within 24 hours, escalate to the Program Manager (escalations via Slack #aiml-automation-ops) for resource assist or scope trade-off. Always update the Jira board to reflect the new sequencing and tag affected owners so downstream teams can adjust their prep work accordingly.
