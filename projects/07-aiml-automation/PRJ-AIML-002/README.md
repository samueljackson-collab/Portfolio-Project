## Architecture Overview
The suite is organized into five modular services that can be shipped independently while sharing model hosting and automation plumbing.

### 1. `monk-seo-core` — Content & SEO Engine
- Keyword research via local Google Trends extraction and TF-IDF clustering.
- On-page optimization powered by BERT-style embeddings and keyword density analysis.
- Technical audits and rank tracking driven by a custom crawler and locally parsed SERP results.

```python
class ContentAISuite:
    def __init__(self):
        self.keyword_research = LocalKeywordAI()
        self.content_optimizer = OnPageAnalyzer()
        self.technical_audit = SiteCrawler()
        self.rank_tracker = SERPMonitor()

    def generate_seo_content(self, topic, target_keywords):
        # Combines best features of SurferSEO + Jasper + MarketMuse
        return self.optimize_content(topic, target_keywords)
```

### 2. `monk-video-factory` — Video Production Studio
- Script-to-storyboard pipeline combining Stable Diffusion, CLIP-based ranking, and OpenShot/FFmpeg automation.
- Automatic captioning and audio cleanup with Whisper TTS/ASR models.
- Smart cutting and template-driven rendering for TikTok/Reels style shorts.

```python
class VideoAIPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.editor = OpenShotEngine()
        self.ai_assets = StableDiffusionGen()
        self.captions = WhisperTTSEngine()
        self.auto_editor = SmartCutAI()

    def create_shorts(self, script, style="tiktok"):
        # Replicates Canva + Lumen5 + Descript workflows
        return self.render_video(script, style)
```

### 3. `monk-ad-brain` — Advertising Intelligence Hub
- Creative variation generation, ROAS-focused bid optimization, and unified performance reporting.
- Audience analysis and demographic clustering for platform-specific targeting.
- Supports ingestion from paid social, search, and email platforms via normalized APIs.

```python
class AdvertisingAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.creative_gen = AdCreativeAI()
        self.audience_ai = DemographicAnalyzer()
        self.bid_optimizer = ROAPredictor()
        self.cross_platform = UnifiedManager()

    def optimize_campaigns(self, platform_data):
        # Replaces Madgicx + AdCreative.ai + Klaviyo core features
        return self.adjust_bids(platform_data)
```

### 4. `monk-competitor-watcher` — Competitor Intelligence System
- Scheduled scraping for price changes, content updates, and ranking shifts.
- Change detection alerts delivered to Slack/email with evidence snapshots.
- Traffic estimation using SimilarWeb-like heuristics and historical baselines.

```python
class CompetitorAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.price_tracker = ScrapyEngine()
        self.content_gap = GapAnalyzer()
        self.alert_system = ChangeDetection()
        self.traffic_estimator = SimilarWebClone()

    def monitor_landscape(self, competitors):
        # Replaces Visualping + SEMrush + SimilarWeb functionality
        return self.generate_alerts(competitors)
```

### 5. `monk-workflow-master` — Automation Orchestrator
### 6. `monk-fulfillment-guardian` — Order Tracking & Shipping Automation
- Predictive delay scoring with ML-ready heuristics tuned for artisan rope batches.
- Automated label creation, carrier tracking, and proactive email notifications.
- 90-day fulfillment watchdog dashboards with actionable remediation guidance.

- Time-zone aware publishing across social and email platforms.
- Customer data sync and triggered automations using n8n and Mautic cores.
- Matomo dashboards for campaign analytics and attribution.

```python
class WorkflowAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scheduler = TimezoneAwareScheduler()
        self.cross_poster = SocialOrchestrator()
        self.email_engine = MauticCore()
        self.analytics = MatomoIntegrator()

    def execute_campaigns(self, workflows):
        # Replaces Zapier + ActiveCampaign + n8n capabilities
        return self.run_automations(workflows)
```
