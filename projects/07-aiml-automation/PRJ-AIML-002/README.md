# PRJ-AIML-002 · AI Marketing Automation Sprint

## Overview
This project packages a 3-week execution sprint to stand up, validate, and operationalize an AI-driven marketing automation loop. The intent is to combine data collection, SEO intelligence, and generative content workflows into a repeatable pipeline with clear ownership, instrumentation, and escalation paths.

## Phasing Plan
| Phase | Duration | Objectives | Tooling Anchor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery & Intake | Days 1–5 | Confirm goals, map data sources, and capture current SEO/content baselines. | Notion, Screaming Frog, Airbyte |
| Build & Automate | Days 6–15 | Stand up ingestion, modeling, and automation layers with quality gates. | dbt, LangChain, FastAPI, Zapier |
| Launch & Optimize | Days 16–21 | Ship to production, harden monitoring, and tune based on live feedback. | Grafana, TestRail, OpenAI APIs |

| Day 19 | Production Launch | Execute release checklist, monitor first-run metrics, and confirm alerts. | Change advisory approval | Taylor Brooks (SRE) |
| Day 20 | **Weekend Buffer** | Swap rule: hold hypercare stand-up, address Sev-2/3, prep for retro. | Production metrics from Day 19 | Sam Jackson (On-call) |
| Day 21 | Retrospective & Handoff | Lead blameless retro, finalize success metrics, transition to operations. | All previous deliverables, metrics snapshot | Sam Jackson (Project Lead) |

**Weekend Buffers & Swap Rules:** Days 6, 13, and 20 are intentionally light-touch. They operate under a swap rule—if the prior weekday closes cleanly, the owner may pull forward Day 22+ backlog items; otherwise, they stabilize open issues. Weekend blockers escalate immediately via Slack `#aiml-delivery` to Sam Jackson (Project Lead) and, if unresolved within 4 hours, to Alex Rivera (Executive Sponsor) for resourcing.

**Escalation Contacts:**
- **Primary:** Sam Jackson — Project Lead (Slack `@sam.jackson`, email `sam@samsjackson.dev`).
- **Secondary:** Alex Rivera — Executive Sponsor (Slack `@alex.rivera`).
- **Tertiary:** Taylor Brooks — SRE On-Call (PagerDuty schedule `AIML-Auto`).

**Communication Cadence:** Daily stand-up (09:00 PT), weekend async check-in (11:00 PT via Slack thread), and blocker triage windows at 14:00 PT on weekdays ensure issues surface before they impact downstream owners.

**Adjustment Guidance:**
- **Push/Pull Rules:** If a dependency slips, push the affected task to the next available buffer (Days 6, 13, or 20) and pull in a ready backlog item of equal or lesser effort to keep throughput steady.
- **Fallback Priorities:** Prioritize restoring data integrity (Days 3–4 outputs), preserving automation stability (Days 10–12), and keeping stakeholder alignment (Day 15) before reintroducing lower-impact enhancements.
- **Escalation Triggers:** Any slip longer than one business day or affecting production launch readiness must be escalated to Alex Rivera for decisioning on additional resourcing or scope trade-offs.
- **Re-Baselining Protocol:** Document variance in Notion, capture revised due dates, and circulate an updated schedule via the weekly status memo; avoid wholesale re-planning unless two or more critical path items slip simultaneously.
