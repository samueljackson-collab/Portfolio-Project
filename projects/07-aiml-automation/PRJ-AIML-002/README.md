# PRJ-AIML-002 · AI/ML Marketing Automation Accelerator

## Project Overview
This runbook packages the processes, tooling, and phased milestones required to deliver an AI-assisted marketing automation foundation for a mid-sized digital organization. It assumes an existing marketing stack with fragmented data, light automation, and no unified performance telemetry.

## Objectives & Success Metrics
- Stand up an integrated CRM, analytics, and automation backbone that surfaces unified lead intelligence.
- Deploy AI-assisted workflows that shorten hand-offs between SEO research, content production, and nurture campaigns.
- Deliver dashboards and runbooks that allow marketing and sales stakeholders to operate autonomously after go-live.

## Tooling Reference
### CRM & Data Backbone
- HubSpot Professional (CRM, workflows, lifecycle stages)
- Airbyte/Hevo pipelines for scheduled data syncs from CMS/e-commerce
- Google Sheets + AppScript for lightweight data transformations

### SEO & Content Intelligence
- Screaming Frog (technical crawl + backlog export)
- Semrush keyword gap + intent clustering
- Notion AI for summary briefs and internal knowledge capture

### Automation & Campaign Orchestration
- HubSpot Sequences + Workflows for lead nurture and routing
- Zapier for bridging edge connectors (webinars, chat, scheduling)
- Make.com scenarios for long-tail enrichment and webhook fan-out

### Analytics & Reporting
- GA4 property with BigQuery export
- Looker Studio dashboards for marketing/sales alignment
- Mixpanel for product-led funnel tracking where applicable

### Knowledge Management & Collaboration
- Confluence for runbooks, SOPs, and decision logs
- Slack (channel-based comms with workflow notifications)
- Loom for asynchronous walkthroughs and approvals

**Blocker Adaptation Guidance:** Reserve light-capacity windows on Days 6, 13, and 20 for weekend or evening catch-up if milestones slip. When blockers arise, swap tasks only within the same phase to preserve dependency chains, escalate access constraints within 24 hours via the program Slack channel, and log any scope adjustments in Confluence so downstream owners can re-sequence deliverables without re-planning the entire engagement.
