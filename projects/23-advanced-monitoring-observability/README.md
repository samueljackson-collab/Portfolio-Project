# Project 23 ¬∑ Advanced Monitoring & Observability Hub

## üìå Overview
Establish a unified observability hub aggregating metrics, logs, traces, and user experience telemetry with self-service dashboards. The platform enables SLO-driven operations, anomaly detection, and automated remediation triggers.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights
- **Telemetry pipeline** built on OpenTelemetry collectors exporting to Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, and ClickHouse.
- **SLO management** using Nobl9 or Sloth to codify error budgets and generate alerting policies tied to business KPIs.
- **User monitoring** via Real User Monitoring (RUM) agents and synthetic probes executed from multiple geographies.
- **Analytics layer** implemented with Grafana, Redash, and Looker for cross-cutting insights and executive reporting.
- **Automation hooks** connecting Alertmanager and PagerDuty to StackStorm playbooks and Incident.io workflows.

```

## üöÄ Implementation Steps
1. **Deploy OpenTelemetry collectors** with auto-scaling DaemonSets and gateway collectors for centralized processing.
2. **Instrument services** using language-specific OTel SDKs capturing RED/USE metrics, structured logs, and trace spans.
3. **Define SLOs** in Git repositories using Sloth YAML, synced into Prometheus recording/alerting rules via CI pipelines.
4. **Build dashboards** per team with golden signals, release markers, and service dependency maps.
5. **Configure synthetic monitoring** using k6 and Grafana Cloud probes, storing results in Loki for correlation.
6. **Automate incident workflows** linking Alertmanager routes to StackStorm packs that create Jira tickets and Slack war rooms.
7. **Continuously improve** by running weekly anomaly detection jobs (Prophet/Arima) and tuning alert thresholds based on burn rate.

## üß© Key Components
```yaml
# projects/23-advanced-monitoring-observability/slo/api-latency.yaml
service: payments-api
slo:
  description: 99% of requests under 300ms latency over 30 days
  objective: 0.99
  window: 30d
  indicator:
    latency:
      success:
        metric: histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{service="payments-api",status!~"5.."}[5m])) by (le))
      total:
        metric: sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count{service="payments-api"}[5m]))

    name: payments-api-latency
    page:
      burn_rate_threshold: 2
      short_window: 5m
      long_window: 1h
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Fail-safes & Operations
- **Runbook automation** triggered from Grafana panels enabling immediate remediation actions via StackStorm.
- **Data retention policies** tiering hot/warm/cold storage with automatic compaction jobs for Loki/Tempo indices.
- **DR readiness** by replicating observability data stores to a secondary region and routinely running failover tests.
- **SLO reviews** embedded into weekly ops meetings with dashboards exporting to PDF for compliance archives.
