## 🎯 Summary

System-minded engineer specializing in building, securing, and operating infrastructure and data-heavy web systems. Hands-on with homelab → production-like setups (wired rack, UniFi network, VPN, backup/restore drills), and pragmatic DevOps/QA practices.

<details><summary><strong>Alternate summaries for tailoring</strong></summary>

**DevOps-forward** DevOps-leaning systems engineer who builds and operates reliable services end-to-end: homelab→production patterns (networking, virtualization, reverse proxy + TLS, backups), monitoring (golden signals), and CI/CD automation.

**QA-forward** Quality-driven systems engineer turning ambiguous requirements into testable runbooks, acceptance criteria, and regression checklists. Builds monitoring dashboards for golden signals and SLOs.

## 🔄 Past Projects Requiring Recovery

Older commercial efforts live in cold storage while I recreate code, processes, and documentation that were lost when a retired workstation took the original knowledge base with it. Fresh assets will be published as they’re rebuilt.

### Commercial E-commerce & Booking Systems (Rebuild in Progress)

**Status:** 🔄 Recovery in progress
**Description** Previously built and managed: resort booking site; high-SKU flooring store; tours site with complex variations. Code and process docs are being rebuilt for publication.
**Links**: [Project README & Recovery Plan](./projects/08-web-data/PRJ-WEB-001/) · [Recovery Timeline](./projects/08-web-data/PRJ-WEB-001/RECOVERY_TIMELINE.md) · [Artifacts (backup catalog, ERD, runbooks)](./projects/08-web-data/PRJ-WEB-001/assets)

> **Recovery plan & timeline:** Catalog and restore SQL workflows and automation scripts (Week 1), re-document content management processes and deployment steps (Week 2), publish refreshed artifacts (Week 3+).
