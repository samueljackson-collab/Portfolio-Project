## 🎯 Summary
System-minded engineer specializing in building, securing, and operating infrastructure and data-heavy web systems. Hands-on with homelab → production-like setups (wired rack, UniFi network, VPN, NAS), virtualization/services (Proxmox/TrueNAS), and observability/backups. Commercial experience shipping and maintaining booking/e-commerce sites with tens of thousands of SKUs and weekly price updates via SQL-driven workflows.

<details><summary><strong>Alternate summaries for tailoring</strong></summary>

**DevOps-forward** DevOps-leaning systems engineer who builds and operates reliable services end-to-end: homelab→production patterns (networking, virtualization, reverse proxy + TLS, backups), metrics/alerts (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/Alertmanager), and automation with PowerShell/Bash/SQL. Experienced with data-heavy e-commerce/booking systems and operational runbooks.

**QA-forward** Quality-driven systems engineer turning ambiguous requirements into testable runbooks, acceptance criteria, and regression checklists. Builds monitoring dashboards for golden signals, designs reliable backup/restore procedures, and uses SQL/automation to validate data integrity across high-SKU catalogs and booking systems.

## 🔄 Past Projects Requiring Recovery

Older commercial efforts live in cold storage while I recreate code, processes, and documentation that were lost when a retired workstation took the original knowledge base with it. Fresh assets will be posted as I rehydrate each workflow from backups and operational notes.

### Commercial E-commerce & Booking Systems (Rebuild in Progress)
**Status** 🔄 Recovering artifacts from backup exports and recreating runbooks.
**Description** Previously built and managed: resort booking site; high-SKU flooring store; tours site with complex variations. Code and process docs are being rebuilt for publication.
**Links**: [Repo/Folder](./projects/08-web-data/PRJ-WEB-001/) · [Evidence](./projects/08-web-data/PRJ-WEB-001/assets) *(placeholder while recovery completes)*

> **Recovery plan & timeline:** Catalog and restore SQL workflows and automation scripts (Week 1), re-document content management processes and deployment steps (Week 2), publish refreshed artifacts and narratives (Week 3).
