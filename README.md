## 🔄 Past Projects Requiring Recovery

Older commercial efforts live in cold storage while I recreate code, processes, and documentation that were lost when a retired workstation took the original knowledge base with it. Fresh assets will be posted as I rehydrate each workflow from backups and operational notes.

### Commercial E-commerce & Booking Systems (Rebuild in Progress)
**Status:** 🔄 Recovery in progress
**Description** Previously built and managed: resort booking site; high-SKU flooring store; tours site with complex variations. Code and process docs are being rebuilt for publication.
**Links**: [Project README](./projects/08-web-data/PRJ-WEB-001/) · [Evidence](./projects/08-web-data/PRJ-WEB-001/assets) *(pending recovery)*

> **Recovery plan & timeline:** Catalog and restore SQL workflows and automation scripts (Week 1), re-document content management processes and deployment steps (Week 2), publish refreshed artifacts and narratives (Week 3).
