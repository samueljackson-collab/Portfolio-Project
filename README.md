## 🎯 Summary
System-minded engineer specializing in building, securing, and operating infrastructure and data-heavy web systems. Hands-on with homelab → production-like setups (wired rack, UniFi network, VPN, NAS), virtualization/services (Proxmox/TrueNAS), and observability/backups. Commercial experience shipping and maintaining booking/e-commerce sites with tens of thousands of SKUs and weekly price updates via SQL-driven workflows.

<details><summary><strong>Alternate summaries for tailoring</strong></summary>

**DevOps-forward** DevOps-leaning systems engineer who builds and operates reliable services end-to-end: homelab→production patterns (networking, virtualization, reverse proxy + TLS, backups), metrics/alerts (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/Alertmanager), and automation with PowerShell/Bash/SQL. Experienced with data-heavy e-commerce/booking systems and operational runbooks.

**QA-forward** Quality-driven systems engineer turning ambiguous requirements into testable runbooks, acceptance criteria, and regression checklists. Builds monitoring dashboards for golden signals, designs reliable backup/restore procedures, and uses SQL/automation to validate data integrity across high-SKU catalogs and booking systems.
