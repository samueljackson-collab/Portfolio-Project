## 🎯 Summary
System-minded engineer specializing in building, securing, and operating infrastructure and data-heavy web systems. Hands-on with homelab → production-like setups (wired rack, UniFi network, VPN, NAS), virtualization/services (Proxmox/TrueNAS), and observability/backups. Commercial experience shipping and maintaining booking/e-commerce sites with tens of thousands of SKUs and weekly price updates via SQL-driven workflows.

<details><summary><strong>Alternate summaries for tailoring</strong></summary>

**DevOps-forward** DevOps-leaning systems engineer who builds and operates reliable services end-to-end: homelab→production patterns (networking, virtualization, reverse proxy + TLS, backups), metrics/alerts (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/Alertmanager), and automation with PowerShell/Bash/SQL. Experienced with data-heavy e-commerce/booking systems and operational runbooks.

**QA-forward** Quality-driven systems engineer turning ambiguous requirements into testable runbooks, acceptance criteria, and regression checklists. Builds monitoring dashboards for golden signals, designs reliable backup/restore procedures, and uses SQL/automation to validate data integrity across high-SKU catalogs and booking systems.

## 🔄 Past Projects Requiring Recovery

Older commercial efforts live in cold storage while I recreate code, processes, and documentation that were lost when a retired workstation took the original knowledge base with it. Fresh assets will be posted as I rehydrate each workflow from backups and operational notes.

### Commercial E-commerce & Booking Systems (Rebuild in Progress)
**Status** 🔄 Recovering artifacts from backup exports and recreating runbooks.
**Description** Previously built and managed: resort booking site; high-SKU flooring store; tours site with complex variations. Code and process docs are being rebuilt for publication.
**Links**: [Repo/Folder](./projects/08-web-data/PRJ-WEB-001/) · [Evidence](./projects/08-web-data/PRJ-WEB-001/assets) *(placeholder while recovery completes)*

> **Recovery plan & timeline:** Catalog and restore SQL workflows and automation scripts (Week 1), re-document content management processes and deployment steps (Week 2), publish refreshed artifacts and narratives (Week 3).

## Success Metrics & Post-Launch Optimization

To keep shipped work improving, each KPI is instrumented with clear ownership, alerting, and review cadences so the team can move from data to action immediately.

| Metric | Data Source | Dashboard/Query | Update Frequency | Owner | Alert Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Booking CTA Conversion Rate | Matomo Goal ID 5 (`booking_cta_click`) on production landing pages | Matomo Dashboard: **Acquisition → Booking CTA Performance** (dashboard ID `7`, filtered to `siteId=3`) | Hourly API sync into n8n cache | Analytics Engineer | < 2.5% rolling 4-hour average |
| Completed Booking Volume | MySQL view `analytics.completed_bookings_vw` via Matomo SQL connector | n8n Workflow **`matomo-booking-sync`** writing to Google Looker Studio report `Bookings & Revenue` (page 2) | Hourly at :15 | Revenue Operations Lead | < 30 bookings/day (projected weekly pace) |
| Checkout Error Rate | Matomo Custom Report `Checkout Funnel Health` using Event Category `checkout_error` | Matomo Dashboard widget `Checkout Errors by Step` (dashboard ID `12`, filter `eventCategory=checkout_error`) | Every 15 minutes | QA Lead | > 3% of sessions with checkout events |
| Average Order Value (AOV) | REST API `/reports/revenue/aov` (internal commerce API v2) pulled by n8n **`commerce-aov-monitor`** | SQL notebook `analytics/notebooks/aov_trend.sql` rendered in Metabase dashboard `Revenue Pulse` (card ID `89`) | Daily at 02:00 UTC | Finance Analyst | < $145 7-day trailing average |

### Instrumentation & Setup Notes
- **Booking CTA Conversion Rate**: Ensure Matomo Goal ID 5 is enabled with the funnel step `Landing Page → CTA Click`. Configure Matomo segment `trafficSource=Paid` to allow filtering in dashboard ID 7. Grant API access token `MATOMO_KPI_READ` to the n8n credential store.
- **Completed Booking Volume**: n8n workflow `matomo-booking-sync` requires read access to the MySQL replica and service account `svc_looker_bookings`. In Looker Studio, apply the filter `Environment = Production` and share the report with the Revenue Ops group.
- **Checkout Error Rate**: Matomo Custom Report must have dimensions `eventCategory`, `eventAction`, and `pageTitle`. Add event tracking to emit `eventCategory=checkout_error` with error codes in `eventAction`. Widget filter `eventAction!=test` excludes QA sandbox noise.
- **Average Order Value**: Create Metabase saved question (card ID 89) using query `SELECT order_date, total_revenue / order_count AS aov FROM revenue.daily_summary WHERE channel != 'Internal'`. Schedule the card to refresh daily with timezone UTC and notify Finance Analyst role.

### Alerting Workflow
1. Matomo thresholds are polled via the relevant API endpoints by n8n workflows (`matomo-kpi-alerts`, `matomo-booking-sync`, `commerce-aov-monitor`).
2. When a KPI crosses its alert threshold, n8n posts a structured message to Slack channel `#growth-alerts` and opens a Jira ticket using project key `KPI` with the breached metric, timeframe, and remediation checklist link.
3. For persistent breaches (>2 consecutive runs), n8n escalates to the on-call owner via Slack direct message and tags the backup owner stored in the workflow metadata.

### Cadence & Accountability
- **Monday KPI Review**: Analytics Engineer leads a 30-minute stand-up reviewing the dashboards above, confirms alert resolutions, and queues follow-up actions in Jira.
- **Mid-week Spot Check (Thursday)**: Owners validate data freshness and document any anomalies directly in the Matomo dashboard annotations.
