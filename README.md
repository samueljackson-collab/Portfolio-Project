## 🎯 Summary

System-minded engineer specializing in building, securing, and operating
infrastructure and data-heavy web systems. Hands-on with homelab →
production-like setups (wired rack, UniFi network, VPN, backup/restore drills),
and pragmatic DevOps/QA practices.

<details><summary><strong>Alternate summaries for tailoring</strong></summary>

**DevOps-forward** DevOps-leaning systems engineer who builds and operates
reliable services end-to-end. Focus areas include homelab → production patterns
(networking, virtualization, reverse proxy + TLS, backups), monitoring (golden
signals), and CI/CD automation.

**QA-forward** Quality-driven systems engineer turning ambiguous requirements
into testable runbooks, acceptance criteria, and regression checklists. Builds
monitoring dashboards for golden signals and SLOs.

## 🔄 Past Projects Requiring Recovery

Older commercial efforts live in cold storage while I recreate code, processes,
and documentation that were lost when a retired workstation took the original
knowledge base with it. Fresh assets will be published as they’re rebuilt.

### Commercial E-commerce & Booking Systems (Rebuild in Progress)

**Status:** 🔄 Recovery in progress

**Description** Previously built and managed: resort booking site; high-SKU
flooring store; tours site with complex variations. Code and process docs are
being rebuilt for publication.
