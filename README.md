## 📁 Repository Status
I'm rebuilding my public portfolio here and migrating assets from private repos and knowledge bases. The sections below capture the current state so you can quickly see what is documented now and what is still being prepped for release.

- **Documentation present:** Summary, skills, experience, education, and contact details (all kept up to date).
- **Documentation in progress:** Project folders with executive summaries are live; redacted evidence is being curated for public release.
- **Next steps:** Stand up a light static site in this repo once the first wave of project documentation lands.

If you'd like early access to draft materials or have specific questions, reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sams-jackson).

## 🎯 Summary
System-minded engineer specializing in building, securing, and operating infrastructure and data-heavy web systems. Hands-on with homelab → production-like setups (wired rack, UniFi network, VPN, NAS), virtualization/services (Proxmox/TrueNAS), and observability/backups. Commercial experience shipping and maintaining booking/e-commerce sites with tens of thousands of SKUs and weekly price updates via SQL-driven workflows.

<details><summary><strong>Alternate summaries for tailoring</strong></summary>

**DevOps-forward** DevOps-leaning systems engineer who builds and operates reliable services end-to-end: homelab→production patterns (networking, virtualization, reverse proxy + TLS, backups), metrics/alerts (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/Alertmanager), and automation with PowerShell/Bash/SQL. Experienced with data-heavy e-commerce/booking systems and operational runbooks.

**QA-forward** Quality-driven systems engineer turning ambiguous requirements into testable runbooks, acceptance criteria, and regression checklists. Builds monitoring dashboards for golden signals, designs reliable backup/restore procedures, and uses SQL/automation to validate data integrity across high-SKU catalogs and booking systems.
