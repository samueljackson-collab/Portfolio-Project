# üöÄ Enterprise-Grade Technical Portfolio

A curated collection of 25 production-ready projects demonstrating senior-level expertise across cloud architecture, platform engineering, DevOps, security, AI, and modern software delivery. This monorepo is structured to mirror a real-world engineering organization with shared tooling, governance, and operational excellence.

> üìö **Start here:**
> - [System Architecture](docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
> - [Security Strategy](docs/SECURITY_STRATEGY.md)
> - [Deployment & Operations Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

## üéØ Portfolio Highlights
- Multi-cloud, multi-runtime coverage: React, FastAPI, Rust, GraphQL, serverless, and Kubernetes workloads.
- Infrastructure-as-code for networking, databases, and static hosting with Terraform and Helm.
- End-to-end DevSecOps with CI/CD pipelines, policy-as-code, observability stacks, and compliance automation.
- AI/ML, big data, and streaming examples connecting Kafka, PySpark, and ML pipelines to production services.
- Strategy and governance artifacts including disaster recovery, runbooks, and security posture reporting.

## üß≠ Navigating the Monorepo
- Each project includes `README.md`, optional `docs/` for ADRs and diagrams, `ops/runbook.md`, and IaC/application code folders.
- Shared conventions, branching model, and promotion process are defined in the [Deployment & Operations Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).
- Security controls, identity strategy, and compliance mapping live in the [Security Strategy](docs/SECURITY_STRATEGY.md).
- Architectural views, integration topology, and dependency graph reside in the [System Architecture](docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## ü§ù Contribution Workflow
1. Review architecture and security docs to understand context.
2. Open an issue outlining scope, success criteria, and validation steps.
3. Create feature branches using `<domain>/<issue-id>-short-description` naming convention.
4. Follow per-project lint/test instructions before opening a PR.
5. Ensure documentation and runbooks remain accurate after changes.
