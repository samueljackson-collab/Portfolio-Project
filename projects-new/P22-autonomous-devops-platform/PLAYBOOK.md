- Routine tasks: Rotate workflow secrets, monitor queue latency, and keep worker autoscaling tuned to backlog.
- Deployment/rollout: follow CI pipeline then environment-specific promotion steps.
- Validation: ensure flow 'Git events trigger workflows that build, scan, deploy, and remediate; health signals feed back to adjust policies.' completes in target environment.
