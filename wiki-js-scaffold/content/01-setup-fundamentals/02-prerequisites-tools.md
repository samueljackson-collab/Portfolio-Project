## 🔧 Required Tools

### 1. Git (Version Control System)

**What is it?**
Git is the core version control system that tracks changes in your code.

**Version Required:** 2.30 or later

**Installation:**
- We'll cover installation in detail in [Lesson 3](./03-git-installation-windows.md)

**How to check if installed:**
```bash
git --version
# Should output: git version 2.30.0 or higher
```

### 2. Text Editor

**Recommended: Visual Studio Code**
- Free, powerful, and widely used
- Built-in Git integration
- Download: [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)

**Alternatives:**
- **Sublime Text** - Lightweight and fast
- **Atom** - GitHub's own editor
- **Notepad++** (Windows) - Simple and reliable
- **vim/emacs** - For experienced terminal users

**Why not Word/Google Docs?**
These add hidden formatting that breaks code. Always use plain text editors.
