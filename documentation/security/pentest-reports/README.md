# Penetration Test Reports

The raw penetration test reports for this portfolio are not included in the public export because they contain scoped system details, tooling outputs, and remediation notes that are restricted to vetted partners.

This directory instead provides an access summary so stakeholders understand what is available and how to request it.

## Available Artifacts
- **Redacted executive summary (PDF)** – high-level findings, risk ratings, and remediation status.
- **Full pentest report (encrypted ZIP)** – methodology, evidence, screenshots, and ticket references.
- **Remediation tracking workbook (spreadsheet)** – issue owners, target dates, and verification logs.

## Access Process
1. Email `security@samsjackson.dev` from an organization-managed account describing the engagement context.
2. Sign the standard non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that will be provided in reply.
3. Upon verification, a time-bound download link and decryption key will be shared over separate channels.

For urgent security incidents, call the on-call line listed in the incident response plan to expedite review.
