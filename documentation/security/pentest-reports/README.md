# Pentest Report Access

Penetration testing evidence for the Portfolio platform is stored in a restricted bucket to protect sensitive findings.

## Requesting Access

1. Open a security request in the internal ticketing system and include the sprint or release the pentest covered.
2. Tag the portfolio security lead and provide a business justification for viewing the report.
3. Await approval; once granted, the requester receives a time-limited download link issued by AWS IAM Identity Center.

## Handling Requirements

- Store reports only in encrypted, access-controlled locations.
- Do not attach raw findings to tickets or chat threads. Reference the report ID instead.
- Follow the remediation tracking workflow in [`documentation/security/compliance-register.md`](../compliance-register.md) for any open issues.

Questions can be directed to the security mailing list listed in [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md#access-controls).
