# Changelog

All notable changes to this portfolio bundle are documented here. The entries capture the consolidation work
that prepared the repository for completion by future contributors or AI agents.

## [Unreleased]
- Portfolio project selection finalized to the 20 projects listed in the role alignment matrix; removed earlier
tentative items and synced the six-month roadmap.
- Repository structure standardized with consistent naming across project folders, documentation, and script
locations; obsolete assets from early drafts were removed.
- Integrated content from proposals, design docs, and POC reports (e.g., Homelab Executive Proposal,
AstraDup research) into the relevant project documentation.
- Expanded numerous draft documents into organized outlines; for example, Operational Monitoring &
Automation now includes a drafted monitoring strategy and IAM Security Hardening contains a partial
security report.
- Added initial placeholder diagrams (e.g., hybrid network sketch, multi-region architecture image) to guide
future polished diagram generation.
- Compiled the Homelab handbook into `Volume_Homelab.pdf` using the existing Pandoc/LaTeX workflow.
- Authored the first edition of the "Portfolio Project Companion Textbook" covering tooling such as Ansible,
Terraform, Prometheus, and Grafana.
- Finalized `Role_Alignment_and_Roadmap_Final.pdf`, mapping each project to target job roles and scheduling
deliverables across a six-month timeline.
- Resolved conflicting or duplicated content between earlier bundles; `FINAL_CURATED_RESOLVED` represents
the cleaned baseline.
- Updated project READMEs for tone and consistency, shifting completed work to past tense and adding
relevant KPIs where available.
- Introduced this `CHANGELOG.md` to track ongoing adjustments.
