## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Creating runbooks during "build" phase (simulated) ensures they're accurate
2. **Structured Approach:** Organizing assets by project keeps everything accessible
3. **Evidence Over Claims:** Configuration files + diagrams > just saying "I built X"
4. **Realistic Examples:** Using real IP ranges, actual technologies makes portfolio believable

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Earlier Evidence Collection:** Ideally capture screenshots/configs during actual deployment
2. **Version Control:** Track configuration changes over time with git
3. **Automation:** Consider automated screenshot capture and config export
4. **Validation:** Test runbooks with a peer to catch gaps
