# Major Update Report

## Version 1.0.0

### Summary
Version 1.0.0 converts the repository into a fully fledged systems engineering portfolio monorepo. The update introduces dedicated services, infrastructure-as-code, automated testing, and end-to-end documentation.

### Breaking Changes
- The legacy documentation-only portfolio structure has been replaced with the monorepo layout. Previous file paths are no longer valid.

### Migration Guide
1. Clone the updated repository.
2. Run `./setup.sh` to install required tooling.
3. Review `docs/onboarding.md` for environment configuration.
4. Use `make dev` to spin up the full stack locally.

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Infrastructure modules initialize without errors.
- [ ] Backend service passes unit and integration tests (`pytest`).
- [ ] Frontend service builds and launches via Vite.
- [ ] Monitoring stack exports Prometheus metrics.
- [ ] GitHub Actions pipelines succeed in CI and security scans.
