# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document provides security guidance for the Portfolio-Project repository and its infrastructure code.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository:

1. **Do NOT open a public issue** - Security vulnerabilities should not be disclosed publicly until patched
2. Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting feature](https://github.com/samueljackson-collab/Portfolio-Project/security/advisories/new)
3. Or contact the repository owner directly through LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/sams-jackson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sams-jackson)

### What to Include in Your Report

- Clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected versions or components
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if known)

**Do not include exploit code in initial reports.**

## Security Best Practices

### For Infrastructure Code (Terraform)

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use `.gitignore` to exclude `*.tfvars` files
   - Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager, Parameter Store, or HashiCorp Vault
   - Use GitHub Actions secrets for CI/CD credentials

2. **Use least-privilege IAM policies**
   - Grant only necessary permissions
   - Use specific resource ARNs instead of wildcards
   - Enable MFA for privileged operations

3. **Enable encryption**
   - Use `storage_encrypted = true` for RDS instances (already implemented)
   - Enable encryption at rest for S3, EBS, and other data stores
   - Use TLS/SSL for data in transit

4. **Protect production resources**
   - Enable `deletion_protection` in production
   - Use `prevent_destroy` lifecycle rules for critical resources
   - Take backups before destructive changes

5. **Review security groups and network access**
   - Default to deny-all, explicitly allow required traffic
   - Avoid `0.0.0.0/0` CIDR blocks except for public-facing services
   - Use VPC endpoints to avoid internet routing

### For Scripts and Automation

1. **Input validation**
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Escape shell arguments to prevent injection

2. **Credential management**
   - Never hardcode passwords or API keys
   - Use environment variables or secret management tools
   - Rotate credentials regularly

3. **Logging and monitoring**
   - Log security-relevant events (authentication, authorization failures)
   - Do not log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
   - Monitor for anomalous activity

### For Dependencies

1. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Regularly update dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
   - Review security advisories for used packages
   - Use `pip-audit` or Dependabot for vulnerability scanning

2. **Pin versions**
   - Specify exact versions for production deployments
   - Use lock files (requirements.txt with pinned versions)
   - Test updates in non-production environments first

## Security Scanning

### Recommended Tools

- **Terraform:** `tflint`, `tfsec`, `checkov`
- **Containers:** `trivy`, `grype`, `snyk`
- **Python:** `bandit`, `safety`, `pip-audit`
- **Secrets:** `gitleaks`, `trufflehog`, `detect-secrets`

### Pre-commit Hooks

Consider setting up pre-commit hooks to catch issues early:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Add to .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
    hooks:
      - id: gitleaks
  - repo: https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint
    hooks:
      - id: tflint
```

## Compliance Considerations

When deploying to production:

- Follow your organization's security policies
- Consider compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC2, etc.)
- Document security controls and evidence
- Conduct security reviews before major releases

## Incident Response

If a security incident occurs:

1. **Contain** - Isolate affected systems
2. **Assess** - Determine scope and impact
3. **Remediate** - Apply fixes and patches
4. **Document** - Record timeline and actions taken
5. **Post-mortem** - Review and improve processes
