# Portfolio Goals and Social Templates

## Public success metrics to track
- Deployment frequency (target ~50/week once pipelines are steady).
- Lead time for changes (reduce from days to hours).
- Change failure rate (target ~87% reduction through canary + rollback).
- MTTR (trend downward with auto-restart and runbooks).
- Observability coverage: services emitting traces/metrics/logs.
- Documentation completeness: README, ADR, runbook, diagram per project.

## LinkedIn blurb (25-project portfolio)
> Delivered a 25-project cloud portfolio featuring GitOps CI/CD (ArgoCD canaries), AWS networking foundations, DR/backup drills, and an observability stack (Prometheus/Grafana/Jaeger). Drove deployment frequency toward 50/week with reduced lead time and automated rollback coverage.

## Resume bullet template
- "Built and operated a 25-project portfolio across AWS/EKS with GitOps delivery; increased deployment frequency toward 50/week while cutting change-failure rate ~87% via canary + automated rollbacks."
- "Implemented observability baseline (Prometheus/Grafana/Jaeger) and health-check auto-restart scripts, shrinking MTTR and improving runbook adherence."

## Sharing guidelines
- Pair metrics with evidence: dashboards, ArgoCD rollout history, and DR drill results.
- Keep placeholder percentages until first runs complete, then overwrite with measured data.
- Link to wiki pages for `/home` and `/projects` plus architecture diagrams for the featured projects.
