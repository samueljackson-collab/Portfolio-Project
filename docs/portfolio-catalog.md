# Portfolio Catalog (Authoritative Project Set)

## Decision
The authoritative portfolio project set is **Projects 1–25** as listed in
[PORTFOLIO_STATUS_UPDATED.md](../PORTFOLIO_STATUS_UPDATED.md). The canonical
project folders are `projects/1-...` through `projects/25-...`. Other project
folders and indexes remain available as historical or supplemental material, but
**do not override** the canonical list or status table.

## Canonical Catalog
- **Source of truth:** [Portfolio Project Status](../PORTFOLIO_STATUS_UPDATED.md)
- **Folder scope:** `projects/1-aws-infrastructure-automation` through
  `projects/25-portfolio-website`
- **Evidence tracking:** [Portfolio Evidence Tracker](./evidence-tracker.md)
