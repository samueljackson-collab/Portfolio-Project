# Research Dossier Examples (Stub)

This directory stores sample outputs generated by `tools/research_agent.py` and downstream automation.

- Name files using `YYYY-MM-DD_topic_template.md` to align with reproducibility standards.
- Include supporting assets (tables, charts) in subfolders named `assets/` alongside the dossier when needed.
- Generated examples should reference the evidence grading rubric and cite sources per `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`.

> Tip: add large or experimental dossiers to `.gitignore` until they are ready for publication.
