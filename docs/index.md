# Portfolio Platform Overview

This documentation describes the FastAPI + React stack that powers the portfolio catalog. The backend provides JWT-protected CRUD endpoints for projects, while the frontend renders cards, detail pages, and an admin-only flow. Use Docker Compose to run the API, Postgres, and Vite frontend together.
