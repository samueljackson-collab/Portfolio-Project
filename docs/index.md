# Samuel Jackson — Security & DevOps Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Sam Jackson, a systems-minded engineer who blends security, DevOps, and documentation rigor to ship reliable services. This site collects my portfolio projects, experiment notes, and supporting evidence so reviewers can quickly understand the impact and how to reproduce it.

## How to use this portfolio

- **Scan the Portfolio Index:** Jump to the [project index](PROJECT_INDEX.md) for a sortable view of all projects by category, status, and slug.
- **Open any project:** Each project links to a detailed README with scenario, responsibilities, architecture notes, and reproduction steps.
- **Reuse the patterns:** Feel free to adapt runbooks, IaC snippets, or detection content for your own environments. Most artifacts are designed to be portable.

## What you'll find

- Security exercises across red/blue/purple teaming, cloud guardrails, and policy work.
- DevOps/SRE initiatives such as GitOps, observability meshes, and resilience testing.
- GRC programs with audit readiness, risk automation, and business continuity planning.

Thanks for visiting! If you want a guided walkthrough, start with the Portfolio Index or open any of the category pages in the navigation.
