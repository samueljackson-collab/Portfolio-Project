4. **Deployment Diagram**
   - Infrastructure topology
   - Network architecture
   - Security zones

**Use Mermaid diagrams** in markdown for version control:

```mermaid
graph TB
    User[End User] --> LB[Load Balancer]
    LB --> API[API Service]
    API --> DB[(Database)]
    API --> Cache[(Redis Cache)]
```

#### 2.3 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
Document all significant decisions in `/docs/ADR/`:

**Format** (`NNNN-title.md`):
```markdown
# ADR-0001: Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-11-10
**Deciders**: Tech Lead, DBA, Security Team

deploy-production:
  needs: [test, security-scan]
  when: manual  # Requires approval
  steps:
    - name: Deploy to Production
      run: |
        terraform apply -auto-approve
        docker push $IMAGE:$TAG
        kubectl set image deployment/app app=$IMAGE:$TAG
        kubectl rollout status deployment/app
    - name: Smoke Tests
      run: ./scripts/smoke-tests.sh
    - name: Notify Slack
      run: |
        curl -X POST $SLACK_WEBHOOK \
          -d "Deployed version $TAG to production"
```

**Manual Steps** (if any):

**Metrics** (Prometheus + Grafana):
- **Golden Signals**: Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation
- **Business Metrics**: User registrations, transactions, revenue
- **Infrastructure**: CPU, memory, disk, network

**Dashboards**:
- `/grafana/api-overview`: API request rates, error rates, latency
- `/grafana/infrastructure`: EC2, RDS, S3 metrics
- `/grafana/business`: KPIs and user activity

**Logs** (Loki or CloudWatch):
- Centralized log aggregation
- Structured logging (JSON format)
- Retention: 30 days hot, 90 days archive

**Traces** (Jaeger or X-Ray):
- Distributed tracing for microservices
- Request correlation across services
- Performance bottleneck identification

#### 6.2 Alerting

**Alert Configuration**:
```yaml
groups:
  - name: api_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.05
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High error rate detected"
          description: "Error rate is {{ $value }}% (threshold: 5%)"
          runbook_url: "https://wiki/runbooks/high-error-rate"
```

**On-Call Rotation**:
- Primary and secondary on-call engineers
- Managed in PagerDuty
- Escalation policy: Page primary → Wait 15 min → Page secondary → Wait 15 min → Page manager

#### 6.3 Runbooks

**Create runbooks for**:
- Common failure scenarios
- Deployment procedures
- Disaster recovery
- Scaling operations

**Runbook Template**:
```markdown
# Runbook: High API Error Rate

## Symptoms
- Error rate alert firing in PagerDuty
- Users reporting 500 errors
- Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes

## Impact
- Users cannot complete transactions
- Revenue loss: ~$X per minute

## Investigation
1. Check Grafana dashboard: /grafana/api-overview
2. Review recent deployments: `kubectl rollout history`
3. Check application logs: `kubectl logs -l app=api --tail=100`
4. Verify database health: `aws rds describe-db-instances`

## Resolution
**If recent deployment**:
- Rollback: `./scripts/rollback.sh`

**If database connection issues**:
- Verify connection pool: `psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity"`
- Increase pool size if needed

**If external API failure**:
- Enable circuit breaker
- Serve cached responses

## Escalation
If unresolved after 30 minutes:
- Page database team
- Notify product manager
- Post in #incident-response Slack channel
```

#### 6.4 Capacity Planning

**Monthly review**:
- Resource utilization trends
- Traffic growth projections
- Database size growth
- Cost optimization opportunities

**Scaling Strategy**:
- **Horizontal**: Add more EC2 instances (auto-scaling group)
- **Vertical**: Increase instance size (requires downtime)
- **Database**: Read replicas, connection pooling, caching

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Monitoring dashboards configured
- ✅ Alerts defined and tested
- ✅ Runbooks created
- ✅ On-call rotation established
- ✅ Capacity plan documented
