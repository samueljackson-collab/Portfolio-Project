# Master Factory Deliverables

This document maintains the consolidated deliverables for the master documentation factory program.
It captures the governance expectations, required artifacts, and the operational cadence that drive
architecture documentation across the portfolio.

The primary audience includes architecture leads, documentation stewards, and platform owners who
need an authoritative list of outputs when spinning up new documentation workstreams.

## Purpose
- Define the scope of the documentation factory deliverables.
- Provide a durable reference for governance and quality controls.
- Offer a single source that downstream tools and templates can depend on.

## Usage
- Reference before kicking off a new documentation effort.
- Use as the baseline for ADR creation and update cycles.
- Align onboarding and training materials with the deliverables below.

## Versioning
- Updated whenever governance or process expectations change.
- Cross-referenced by ADRs and documentation indexes for traceability.

## Summary Snapshot (Reference Lines 335-360)
These deliverables feed the ADR set and should remain stable for downstream tooling.

1. **Documentation Factory Pipeline** — Centralized flow that standardizes intake, authoring, review,
   and publication for portfolio docs, ensuring repeatable quality gates and hand-offs.
2. **Decision Log Requirements** — Maintain numbered ADRs for architectural and process decisions,
   including context, decision, and consequence sections to drive auditability.
3. **Index Integration** — Every new artifact must register with the documentation indexes (portfolio
   master index, doc hub, and wiki navigation) to stay discoverable and in sync.
4. **Quality & Release Controls** — Pre-release checklists must verify templates, links, and runbooks
   before publishing updates across the factory outputs.
5. **Change Governance Cadence** — Quarterly reviews align deliverables with evolving standards,
   synchronizing training materials, templates, and automation scripts.

These items serve as the authoritative source for any derivative ADRs or runbooks.
