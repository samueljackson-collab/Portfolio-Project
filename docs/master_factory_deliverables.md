# Master Factory Deliverables

This file captures the authoritative summary of the Master Factory deliverables used across portfolio documentation and architecture decision records.
It intentionally reserves a summary block at lines 335-360 so other artifacts can deep-link to a stable reference section.
The content below provides extended context on the operating model, quality controls, and delivery guardrails that inform downstream ADRs.

## Purpose and Scope
- Provide a single source of truth for the core factory deliverables.
- Clarify expectations for engineering, platform, and documentation outputs.
- Anchor decision records to an immutable summary section for long-term traceability.

## Usage Notes
1. Reference this document when authoring ADRs or onboarding new contributors.
2. Keep the summary block at lines 335-360 unchanged to preserve link stability.
3. Update earlier context sections as processes evolve while leaving the summary intact.

## Extended Context
- The Master Factory model emphasizes reproducible delivery patterns across diverse projects.
- Automation-first practices reduce variance between deployments and shorten feedback loops.
- Security, observability, and documentation are treated as first-class deliverables.
- Cross-functional review gates ensure architecture, operations, and compliance stay aligned.
- Knowledge sharing via indexes and handbooks keeps onboarding time low while maintaining consistency.
- Iterative improvements are encouraged, but the core guardrails remain stable to avoid churn.
- Each deliverable is mapped to a responsible owner, acceptance criteria, and validation steps.
- Metrics such as deployment frequency, lead time, and incident recovery guide prioritization.
- Dependencies between infrastructure, application code, and documentation are cataloged early.
- A shared vocabulary ('factory' terminology) minimizes ambiguity in cross-team communication.

## Master Factory Deliverables Summary (Reference Block)

The following items, located deliberately at lines 335-360, summarize the non-negotiable outputs of the Master Factory initiative.
They pair context, the decision that locks in the work product, and the intended consequences for the broader portfolio.

1. **Architecture Runway & Standards**
   - **Context**: Heterogeneous projects require a shared set of blueprints, integration contracts, and reference implementations.
   - **Decision**: Maintain a centralized architecture runway with vetted patterns (APIs, data flows, infra modules) to accelerate builds.
   - **Consequences**: Teams inherit consistent interfaces, reducing integration risk and simplifying audits.

2. **CI/CD Automation & Quality Gates**
   - **Context**: Manual promotion steps slowed releases and created drift between environments.
   - **Decision**: Standardize on automated pipelines with policy-as-code gates for testing, security scanning, and artifact promotion.
   - **Consequences**: Release cadence improves while compliance evidence is captured automatically.

3. **Security & Compliance Baseline**
   - **Context**: Expanding surface area introduced inconsistent credential handling and review coverage.
   - **Decision**: Enforce a security baseline (secrets management, least privilege, SBOMs, threat modeling) baked into onboarding checklists.
   - **Consequences**: Security posture is measurable, repeatable, and auditable across all projects.

4. **Observability & SLO Enforcement**
   - **Context**: Lack of unified telemetry delayed incident triage and obscured reliability metrics.
   - **Decision**: Deliver a shared observability stack (logs, metrics, traces, runbooks) with SLO definitions wired into alerting.
   - **Consequences**: Operations gains faster detection and response, and product teams can manage error budgets proactively.

5. **Documentation & Knowledge Hub**
   - **Context**: Documentation was fragmented, making onboarding and cross-team coordination difficult.
   - **Decision**: Centralize guides, indexes, and ADRs in a discoverable knowledge hub with mandatory linkage from root indexes.
   - **Consequences**: Contributors can locate authoritative guidance quickly, and decision traceability is preserved over time.

6. **Portfolio-Wide Delivery Metrics**
   - **Context**: Leadership required a consistent view of delivery health and value realized across the portfolio.
   - **Decision**: Publish a metric pack (lead time, MTTR, deployment frequency, coverage) refreshed via automated reporting jobs.
   - **Consequences**: Decision-makers have a unified dashboard for prioritization and risk management.

7. **Resilience & Recovery Playbooks**
   - **Context**: Incident response varied widely, prolonging outages and increasing operational toil.
   - **Decision**: Provide standard playbooks for backup, restore, failover, and chaos testing tailored to shared architectures.
   - **Consequences**: Recovery times shrink, and post-incident reviews feed continuous resilience improvements.
