## 🎯 Problem Statement

### The Observability Challenge

Modern distributed systems generate signals across multiple dimensions, but siloed
tools create dangerous blind spots:

**The Correlation Problem**: A latency spike in the API could be caused by database
slowness, network issues, upstream dependencies, or application bugs. Without
correlation, engineers play detective across multiple dashboards.

**The Alert Fatigue Problem**: Each monitoring tool generates its own alerts. Teams
are overwhelmed by notifications, most of which are noise. Critical alerts get
lost in the flood.

**The Context Problem**: An alert fires at 3 AM. The on-call engineer has no context.
Which dashboard should they check? What runbook applies? What changed recently?

**The Cardinality Problem**: High-cardinality data (unique user IDs, request IDs)
is valuable for debugging but expensive to store. Teams compromise between cost
and visibility.


**Business Impact:**
- Extended MTTR from context switching between tools
- Alert fatigue leads to ignored critical alerts
- On-call burnout from poorly actionable alerts
- Hidden issues that only manifest in production
- Excessive monitoring costs from inefficient tooling


### How This Project Solves It


**Unified observability connects the three pillars:**

1. **Correlated Signals**: Trace IDs link metrics, logs, and traces. Jump from
   alert to relevant logs to distributed trace in one click.

2. **Intelligent Alerting**: ML-powered anomaly detection reduces noise. Alerts
   include context—recent deploys, related incidents, runbook links.

3. **SLO-Based Approach**: Define Service Level Objectives. Alert on error budget
   burn rate, not raw metrics. Focus on user impact.

4. **Cost-Efficient Storage**: Sampling and aggregation for high-volume data.
   Detailed retention for recent data, summarized for historical.


### Key Capabilities Delivered

- ✅ **Incident detection**
- ✅ **Automated remediation**

## ✅ Best Practices

### Infrastructure

| Practice | Description | Why It Matters |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Infrastructure as Code** | Define all resources in version-controlled code | Reproducibility, audit trail, peer review |
| **Immutable Infrastructure** | Replace instances, don't modify them | Consistency, easier rollback, no drift |
| **Least Privilege** | Grant minimum required permissions | Security, blast radius reduction |
| **Multi-AZ Deployment** | Distribute across availability zones | High availability during AZ failures |

### Security

- ⛔ **Never** hardcode credentials in source code
- ⛔ **Never** commit secrets to version control
- ✅ **Always** use IAM roles over access keys
- ✅ **Always** encrypt data at rest and in transit
- ✅ **Always** enable audit logging (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs)

### Operations

1. **Observability First**
   - Instrument code before production deployment
   - Establish baselines for normal behavior
   - Create actionable alerts, not noise

2. **Automate Everything**
   - Manual processes don't scale
   - Runbooks should be scripts, not documents
   - Test automation regularly

3. **Practice Failure**
   - Regular DR drills validate recovery procedures
   - Chaos engineering builds confidence
   - Document and learn from incidents

### Code Quality

```python
# ✅ Good: Clear, testable, observable
class PaymentProcessor:
    def __init__(self, gateway: PaymentGateway, metrics: MetricsClient):
        self.gateway = gateway
        self.metrics = metrics
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    def process(self, payment: Payment) -> Result:
        self.logger.info(f"Processing payment {payment.id}")
        start = time.time()

        try:
            result = self.gateway.charge(payment)
            self.metrics.increment("payments.success")
            return result
        except GatewayError as e:
            self.metrics.increment("payments.failure")
            self.logger.error(f"Payment failed: {e}")
            raise
        finally:
            self.metrics.timing("payments.duration", time.time() - start)

# ❌ Bad: Untestable, no observability
def process_payment(payment):
    return requests.post(GATEWAY_URL, json=payment).json()
```

## ⚙️ Operational Guide

### Monitoring & Alerting

| Metric Type | Tool | Dashboard |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| **Metrics** | Prometheus | Grafana `http://localhost:3000` |
| **Logs** | Loki | Grafana Explore |
| **Traces** | Tempo/Jaeger | Grafana Explore |

# Request latency (P99)
histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))

# Error rate
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) /
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))

# Resource utilization
container_memory_usage_bytes / container_spec_memory_limit_bytes
```

### Common Operations

| Task | Command | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| View logs | `kubectl logs -f deploy/app` | Debugging issues |
| Scale up | `kubectl scale deploy/app --replicas=5` | Handling load |
| Rollback | `kubectl rollout undo deploy/app` | Bad deployment |
| Port forward | `kubectl port-forward svc/app 8080:80` | Local debugging |
| Exec into pod | `kubectl exec -it deploy/app -- bash` | Investigation |

### Runbooks

<details>
<summary><strong>🔴 High Error Rate</strong></summary>

**Symptoms:** Error rate exceeds 1% threshold

**Investigation:**
1. Check recent deployments: `kubectl rollout history deploy/app`
2. Review error logs: `kubectl logs -l app=app --since=1h | grep ERROR`
3. Check dependency health: `make check-dependencies`
4. Review metrics dashboard for patterns

**Resolution:**
- If recent deployment: `kubectl rollout undo deploy/app`
- If dependency failure: Check upstream service status
- If resource exhaustion: Scale horizontally or vertically

**Escalation:** Page on-call if not resolved in 15 minutes
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🟡 High Latency</strong></summary>

**Symptoms:** P99 latency > 500ms

**Investigation:**
1. Check traces for slow operations
2. Review database query performance
3. Check for resource constraints
4. Review recent configuration changes

**Resolution:**
- Identify slow queries and optimize
- Add caching for frequently accessed data
- Scale database read replicas
- Review and optimize N+1 queries
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔵 Deployment Failure</strong></summary>

**Symptoms:** ArgoCD sync fails or pods not ready

**Investigation:**
1. Check ArgoCD UI for sync errors
2. Review pod events: `kubectl describe pod <pod>`
3. Check image pull status
4. Verify secrets and config maps exist

**Resolution:**
- Fix manifest issues and re-sync
- Ensure image exists in registry
- Verify RBAC permissions
- Check resource quotas
</details>

### Disaster Recovery

**RTO Target:** 15 minutes
**RPO Target:** 1 hour

```bash
# Failover to DR region
./scripts/dr-failover.sh --region us-west-2

# Validate data integrity
./scripts/dr-validate.sh

# Failback to primary
./scripts/dr-failback.sh --region us-east-1
```

## 🌍 Real-World Scenarios

These scenarios demonstrate how this project applies to actual business situations.

### Scenario: Production Traffic Surge

**Challenge:** Application needs to handle 5x normal traffic during peak events.

**Solution:** Auto-scaling policies trigger based on CPU and request metrics.
Load testing validates capacity before the event. Runbooks document
manual intervention procedures if automated scaling is insufficient.

---

### Scenario: Security Incident Response

**Challenge:** Vulnerability discovered in production dependency.

**Solution:** Automated scanning detected the CVE. Patch branch created
and tested within hours. Rolling deployment updated all instances with
zero downtime. Audit trail documented the entire response timeline.
