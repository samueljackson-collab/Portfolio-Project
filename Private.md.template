PRIVATE AI INSTRUCTIONS (TEMPLATE)

This file is a template for internal AI instructions, prompt engineering notes, and operational runbooks. DO NOT commit your filled Private.md to the public repository. Instead, store the completed Private.md in a private vault (private repo, secrets manager, or encrypted storage).

Summary for senior developers (technical, concise):
- Purpose: central store for system prompts, orchestration logic, input/output contracts, and safety/post-processing.
- Token limits: prefer short, deterministic prompts. Record expected token consumption and model settings.
- Auth: describe token formats, rotation cadence, and verification endpoints.
- Safety: list content filters, sanitization steps, and allowed post-processing.
- Tests: include sanitized sample inputs & expected outputs for regression tests.
- Deployment: describe where prompts are accessed at runtime and how they are versioned.

Access: restrict to designated roles and rotate any referenced keys immediately after moving.
