# Migration Notes

## Legacy Content
- The original repository contained a single `README.md` describing personal experience and projects.
- That content is now preserved in `docs/legacy/ORIGINAL_PORTFOLIO_README.md` for archival purposes.

## Restructuring Summary
- Introduced a `portfolio/` root containing backend, frontend, infrastructure, and documentation assets.
- Added governance, roadmap, and operational documents to support long-term maintenance.
- Established standard tooling (pre-commit, Makefile, requirements, package scripts) for consistent workflows.

## Data Handling
- No binary or unsupported assets were provided, so `data/misc/` remains available for future imports.
