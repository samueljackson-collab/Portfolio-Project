    "collection": "# Research Collection\n\n- **Search Patterns** – Use boolean operators, `site:` filters, and advanced parameters (filetype:pdf).\n- **Harvesting** – Store URLs, titles, authors, and access dates in a structured table.\n- **Duplicate Suppression** – Normalize URLs, remove tracking parameters, and dedupe by canonical title.\n- **Citation Capture** – Record citations in APA format with direct quotes/snippets.\n- **Tooling** – Recommend `curl`, `wget`, APIs, or manual retrieval with notes on licensing.\n",
    "analysis": "# Research Analysis\n\n- **Claims Table** – Column for claim, supporting evidence, confidence, and counterpoints.\n- **Risk Flags** – Highlight high-variance findings, contested sources, or regulatory implications.\n- **Counter-Arguments** – Prompt deeper investigation to challenge assumptions.\n- **Synthesis Templates** – Provide narrative outline: context, findings, implications, recommendations.\n",
    "reporting": "# Research Reporting\n\n## Outline\n1. Executive Summary\n2. Key Findings\n3. Recommendations\n4. Risks & Mitigations\n5. Appendix (raw notes, citations)\n\n## Guidance\n- Use tables for side-by-side comparisons.\n- Provide action items with owners and due dates when possible.\n- Include citation list in consistent style (APA/Chicago).\n",
    "validation": "# Research Validation\n\n- **Verification Checklist** – Confirm citation accuracy, link accessibility, and data freshness.\n- **Reproducibility Steps** – Document search queries, filters, timestamps, and tools.\n- **Red Team Prompts** – Challenge conclusions, identify missing perspectives, and stress-test recommendations.\n- **Sign-off** – Capture reviewer name, date, and outcome (approved/needs revisions).\n"
