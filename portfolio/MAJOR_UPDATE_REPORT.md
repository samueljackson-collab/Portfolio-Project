# Major Update Report

## Summary
- Established a production-style monorepo for showcasing portfolio projects.
- Added CI/CD automation and infrastructure scaffolding for consistent deployments.
- Documented operational practices including runbooks, dashboards, and quality gates.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Environment drift between local and CI environments.  
  **Mitigation:** Docker Compose stack and `tools/bootstrap.py` ensure reproducible setups.
- **Risk:** Secrets mishandling.  
  **Mitigation:** `.env.example` files guide secure configuration without storing secrets.
- **Risk:** Coverage regression below 80%.  
  **Mitigation:** `pytest.ini` enforces the threshold and CI blocks merges on failure.

## Next Steps
- Expand CRUD resources and add role-based authorization.
- Integrate real observability stack and connect Grafana dashboards to live data sources.
- Automate Helm deployment validation against ephemeral review environments.
