# Portfolio Platform Specification

## Goals
- Provide a cohesive showcase of engineering capabilities across backend, frontend, infrastructure, and operations.
- Demonstrate production-readiness through automated testing, CI/CD, and documentation.

## Functional Requirements
- Users can register, authenticate, and manage content entries via REST APIs.
- Frontend displays API health and serves as a foundation for richer portfolio views.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Backend code coverage >= 80% via pytest.
- Infrastructure defined with Terraform and stored in version control.
- CI/CD covers linting, testing, container builds, SBOM generation, and deployment stubs.

## Future Enhancements
- Add role-based access control and analytics dashboards.
- Integrate real monitoring/alerting sources into observability assets.
