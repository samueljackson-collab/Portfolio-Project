# Usage Guide

This document explains how to execute the portfolio program week by week, including cadences, deliverables, and review loops.

## Phase Overview
1. **Phase 1 – Study the System (Week 0)**
   - Consume all onboarding material.
   - Capture notes and clarify questions.
2. **Phase 2 – Build Projects (Weeks 1-12)**
   - Work in two-week sprints per project.
   - Alternate between implementation and documentation focus.
3. **Phase 3 – Polish and Publish (Weeks 13-14)**
   - Final editing, accessibility checks, and recruiter packaging.

## Weekly Cadence
| Day | Focus | Output |
| --- | ----- | ------ |
| Mon | Scope & plan | Updated task board, refined acceptance criteria |
| Tue | Implementation block #1 | Code/config updates, architecture notes |
| Wed | Implementation block #2 | Tests, automation, evidence capture |
| Thu | Documentation day | README updates, ADRs, runbooks |
| Fri | Review & demo prep | Recorded walkthrough, metrics summary |
| Sat | Buffer or learning | Optional deep dives or cleanup |
| Sun | Rest & reflection | Retrospective notes, upcoming adjustments |

## Artifact Checklist per Project
- Executive summary with business value.
- Architecture diagram and design decisions log.
- Infrastructure-as-Code or automation scripts.
- Runbooks, troubleshooting guides, and operational metrics.
- Soft skill narratives tied to real interactions or simulations.
- Evidence folder with screenshots, logs, metrics exports.

## Feedback Loops
1. **Self-Review:** Use the project template checklists to ensure completeness.
2. **Peer or Mentor Review:** Share draft artifacts for critique at least once per project.
3. **Recruiter Simulation:** Practice explaining the project in 3, 10, and 30 minute formats.

## Tracking Progress
- Maintain a Kanban board or project tracker for visibility.
- Log hours per activity to ensure balanced focus between technical and soft skill work.
- Update a metrics dashboard (see `portfolio_structure.md`) with portfolio performance indicators.

## Risk Mitigation
- Schedule contingency time every week.
- Keep infrastructure costs in check with automation to tear down environments.
- Version control everything; commit early and often.
