# Recruiter Positioning Guide

Use this playbook to tailor the portfolio narrative for different recruiting personas.

## Personas & Priorities
| Persona | What They Care About | Portfolio Emphasis |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Technical Recruiter | Keyword alignment, skill verification, ease of navigation | Highlight skill matrices, quick links to each project summary |
| Hiring Manager | Problem-solving ability, leadership, impact | Focus on business outcomes, decision logs, and retrospectives |
| Senior Engineer Interviewer | Depth of technical knowledge, trade-offs, operational rigor | Provide architecture diagrams, IaC repositories, incident reports |
| HR/Business Stakeholder | Culture fit, communication, soft skills | Showcase soft skill stories, collaboration examples, testimonials |

## Navigation Paths
- **DevOps & Platform Roles:** Start with Project 1 (Kubernetes Infrastructure) and Project 2 (CI/CD Pipeline).
- **Security Roles:** Direct to Project 3 (Security Hardening) and the incident response sections of Project 5.
- **SRE & Operations Roles:** Highlight Project 4 (Observability Stack) and the metrics/SLI dashboards.
- **Leadership Roles:** Provide the portfolio overview, soft skills framework, and cross-project impact metrics.

## Communication Templates
1. **Initial Outreach Email**
   - 2-3 sentence summary of who you are.
   - Links to the most relevant projects for the role.
   - Call-to-action for a call or interview.
2. **Interview Prep Brief**
   - Bullet summary of each project with quantifiable impact.
   - Key stories aligned to behavioral questions.
   - Questions to ask the interviewer.
3. **Follow-Up Message**
   - Thank them for their time.
  - Reinforce one insight from the conversation.
  - Link to any supplementary artifacts discussed.

## Metrics to Share
- Reduction in deployment time, incident MTTR, or infrastructure cost.
- Uptime or reliability improvements tied to observability/automation.
- Security posture enhancements (e.g., vulnerabilities remediated, compliance status).
- Process improvements (e.g., onboarding time, documentation completeness).

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Sending generic messages without tailoring to the role.
- Overloading with technical detail before confirming interest.
- Forgetting to highlight soft skills or leadership moments.
- Neglecting follow-up communication.

Use this guide whenever you prepare outreach, interviews, or performance reviews.
