# Glossary Template

Create consistent, beginner-friendly explanations for technical terms referenced throughout your portfolio. This template ensures each entry is accurate, accessible, and aligned with your documentation style.

---

## 1. Writing Guidelines

1. **Audience:** Assume the reader is an executive or recruiter with limited technical background.
2. **Clarity:** Use plain language first, then add technical depth for engineers.
3. **Context:** Explain why the term matters to your projects and business outcomes.
4. **Consistency:** Follow the structure below for every entry.
5. **Evidence:** Link to artifacts (diagrams, runbooks, code) when relevant.

### 1.1 Formatting Rules
- Title case for term names.
- Include pronunciation if helpful (e.g., "Kubernetes (koo-burr-NET-eez)").
- Provide 2–3 bullet points for business relevance.
- Use examples referencing your portfolio projects.

## 2. Glossary Entry Template

```
## [Term Name]

**Plain-Language Definition:** One-sentence explanation without jargon.

**Why It Matters:**
- Business relevance bullet #1.
- Business relevance bullet #2.
- Optional bullet #3.

**In This Portfolio:**

## 3. Sample Entries

### Kubernetes

**Plain-Language Definition:** An open-source system that automates how applications run across many servers so they stay reliable and easy to update.

**Technical Description:** Kubernetes orchestrates containerized workloads by managing scheduling, scaling, networking, and storage. It uses controllers, the API server, etcd, and worker nodes to ensure desired state. Declarative manifests define how services deploy and heal automatically.

**Why It Matters:**
- Ensures applications stay online even when individual servers fail.
- Enables rapid, low-risk deployments through automated rollouts and rollbacks.
- Provides a standardized platform for security controls and observability.

**In This Portfolio:**
- [Kubernetes Infrastructure Platform](./projects/01-sde-devops/PRJ-SDE-001/README.md) – cluster design ADRs and upgrade runbook.
- [Observability Stack](./projects/01-sde-devops/PRJ-SDE-002/README.md) – integrates metrics and alerting.

**Related Terms:** [GitOps](#gitops), [Service Mesh](#service-mesh)

### CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery)

**Plain-Language Definition:** A set of practices that automatically tests and delivers code changes so teams ship features faster with fewer errors.

**Technical Description:** CI/CD pipelines integrate code into a shared repository, trigger automated builds and tests, and deliver artifacts to environments using scripted workflows. Tooling may include GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI, with automated quality gates, security scanning, and deployment strategies like blue/green or canary.

**Why It Matters:**
- Shortens feedback loops, catching issues before production.
- Increases deployment frequency and reliability.
- Provides audit trails for compliance and change management.

**In This Portfolio:**
- [CI/CD Pipeline Factory](./projects/01-sde-devops/PRJ-SDE-002/README.md) – pipeline YAML, testing matrix, ROI analysis.
- [Incident Response System](./projects/03-cybersecurity/PRJ-CYB-OPS-002/README.md) – automated detection deployment workflow.

**Related Terms:** [Infrastructure as Code](#infrastructure-as-code), [Release Management](#release-management)

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Plain-Language Definition:** Managing infrastructure (servers, networks, permissions) with code so it can be versioned, tested, and automated like software.

**Technical Description:** IaC tools such as Terraform, Pulumi, or AWS CloudFormation define infrastructure declaratively. They enable idempotent provisioning, environment parity, and integration with CI/CD. State management and modular design support reusable, auditable infrastructure changes.

**Why It Matters:**
- Reduces manual configuration errors and drift.
- Enables rapid environment provisioning for testing and production.
- Supports compliance by providing change history and approvals.

**In This Portfolio:**
- [Kubernetes Infrastructure Platform](./projects/01-sde-devops/PRJ-SDE-001/README.md) – Terraform modules for networking and cluster provisioning.
- [Security Hardening Program](./projects/03-cybersecurity/PRJ-CYB-BLUE-001/README.md) – policy-as-code examples.

**Related Terms:** [CI/CD](#ci-cd-continuous-integration--continuous-delivery), [Configuration Management](#configuration-management)

### Observability

**Plain-Language Definition:** The ability to understand how systems behave by collecting metrics, logs, and traces.

**Technical Description:** Observability combines telemetry pipelines, storage backends, and visualization/alerting layers. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and OpenTelemetry deliver insights into latency, errors, throughput, and resource usage. SLOs and error budgets guide reliability decisions.

**Why It Matters:**
- Detects issues before customers notice them.
- Supports incident response with actionable data.
- Informs capacity planning and optimization.

**In This Portfolio:**
- [Observability & Reliability Stack](./projects/01-sde-devops/PRJ-SDE-002/README.md) – dashboards, alert runbooks, and SLO definitions.
- [Incident Response & Continuity System](./projects/03-cybersecurity/PRJ-CYB-OPS-002/README.md) – detection pipeline metrics.

**Related Terms:** [SLO](#service-level-objective-slo), [Alert Fatigue](#alert-fatigue)

### Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

**Plain-Language Definition:** A short document that explains an important technical decision, the options considered, and why the final choice was made.

**Technical Description:** ADRs capture context, decision drivers, alternatives, and consequences. They are version-controlled artifacts that provide a history of architectural thinking, enabling future engineers to understand trade-offs and revisit decisions when conditions change.

**Why It Matters:**
- Prevents knowledge loss during handoffs or turnover.
- Supports alignment with stakeholders by explaining reasoning.
- Enables faster onboarding by documenting system evolution.

**In This Portfolio:**
- All projects include ADR summaries with links to full records (see `project_template.md`).

**Related Terms:** [Trade-Off Analysis](#trade-off-analysis), [Design Review](#design-review)

## 4. Maintenance Process

1. **Add Entries:** Whenever a new term appears in documentation, create an entry or link to an existing one.
2. **Review Cadence:** Quarterly review to retire outdated references or update definitions with new learnings.
3. **Linking Strategy:** Hyperlink terms in project documentation to glossary anchors for quick reference.
4. **Versioning:** Note major glossary updates in `final/CHANGELOG.md`.
