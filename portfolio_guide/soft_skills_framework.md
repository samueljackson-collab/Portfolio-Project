# Soft Skills Framework

Technical excellence alone is not enough. This framework shows how to intentionally demonstrate the soft skills hiring managers expect from senior engineers.

## Core Competencies
| Competency | Description | How to Demonstrate |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Communication | Clear written and verbal updates; context-aware explanations | Project briefings, recorded walkthroughs, stakeholder summaries |
| Leadership | Driving outcomes, unblocking teams, mentoring others | Decision logs, meeting facilitation notes, coaching scenarios |
| Collaboration | Working across functions, incorporating feedback | Cross-team coordination stories, feedback loops, joint retros |
| Ownership | Accountability for results, proactive risk management | Incident reviews, cost optimization actions, backlog grooming |
| Strategic Thinking | Connecting tasks to business value | ROI calculations, OKR alignment, impact dashboards |

## Embedding Soft Skills in Projects
1. **Executive Summaries:** Highlight the business problem, stakeholders, and your role.
2. **Decision Records:** Document trade-offs, alternatives considered, and collaboration notes.
3. **Runbooks:** Showcase clarity of communication and empathy for operators.
4. **Retrospectives:** Reflect on what went well, what failed, and how you iterated.
5. **Evidence Packets:** Include emails, meeting notes, or chat excerpts (sanitized) that show leadership behaviors.

## Storytelling Framework
Use the STAR+V structure:
- **Situation:** What context or challenge existed?
- **Task:** What responsibility did you own?
- **Action:** What did you do? Include technical steps and soft skill behaviors.
- **Result:** Quantify the outcome.
- **Value:** Connect the result to business priorities or user impact.

## Measuring Soft Skill Growth
- Track how many artifacts explicitly reference soft skills.
- Gather feedback from peers or mentors on clarity and influence.
- Record improvements in communication speed (e.g., fewer clarifying follow-ups needed).
- Note leadership moments such as facilitating incident calls or driving alignment across teams.

## Implementation Tips
- Schedule weekly reflection time to capture stories while they are fresh.
- Translate informal experiences (volunteering, mentoring, freelancing) into professional narratives.
- Use consistent language across resumes, LinkedIn, and the portfolio to reinforce the message.

Make soft skills as tangible as your infrastructure diagrams; this is your competitive advantage.
