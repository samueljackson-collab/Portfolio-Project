# Portfolio Guide Overview

This guide explains the strategy behind the five-project portfolio system and how each component reinforces the overall narrative.

## Vision
Create a recruiter-friendly portfolio that demonstrates:
- Production-quality infrastructure, automation, and operations work.
- Measurable business impact tied to each project.
- Soft skills woven into every artifact, making capabilities explicit.

## Pillars of the System
1. **Architecture First** – Every project begins with design documents, diagrams, and decision records.
2. **Soft Skills Integration** – Communication, leadership, and collaboration stories are highlighted alongside the technical deliverables.
3. **Evidence Packets** – Screenshots, logs, metrics, and runbooks prove that the solutions work in realistic conditions.
4. **Guided Navigation** – Recruiters with different priorities can quickly find relevant material.

## Projects At a Glance
| Project | Core Theme | Key Outcomes |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1. Kubernetes Infrastructure | Platform engineering, IaC | Scalable, cost-aware cluster with documented operations |
| 2. CI/CD Pipeline | Automation, governance | Secure, auditable deployment workflow with policy gates |
| 3. Security Hardening | DevSecOps, compliance | Defense-in-depth controls with measurable risk reduction |
| 4. Observability Stack | SRE, analytics | Golden-signal dashboards and alerting with MTTR improvements |
| 5. Incident Response | Operations, leadership | Tested playbooks, communication plans, and retrospectives |

## How to Use This Guide
1. Complete the Phase 1 study plan in `START_HERE.md`.
2. Read the `USAGE_GUIDE.md` for working cadences and weekly deliverables.
3. Dive into the `soft_skills_framework.md` to map soft skills to project artifacts.
4. Review `project_template.md` before starting any implementation work.
5. Revisit `recruiter_positioning.md` when preparing interviews or outreach messages.

## What Success Looks Like
- Each project contains architecture docs, code samples, runbooks, and evidence.
- The portfolio tells a coherent story of growth from foundational infrastructure to mature operations.
- Recruiters can find tailored summaries, while engineers can explore deep technical details.

Stay intentional, document everything, and iterate based on feedback.
