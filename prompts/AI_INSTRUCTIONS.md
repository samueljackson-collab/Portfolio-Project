# Prompt Harness Overview

The prompts in this directory document the contract between our internal automation and the portfolio repository. Detailed
automation cues now live in `internal/AI_NOTES.md` so that public artifacts focus on implementation guidance rather than
machine-oriented directives.

```text
# Maintainer guidance
# - Update BUILD_SPEC.json when services or technology stacks change.
# - Keep AI_NOTES.md in sync with the coding standards referenced by CONTRIBUTING.md.
# - Treat this directory as the source of truth for automated asset generation.
```
