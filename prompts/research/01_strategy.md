# Research Strategy: Breadth to Depth

This playbook establishes a repeatable approach for scanning broadly, converging on the highest-signal sources, and documenting findings that withstand scrutiny.

## 1. Framing the Inquiry
- **Clarify the assignment**: capture the primary question, decision-maker, timeline, and required deliverables.
- **Define success**: what evidence is required to inform or convince the stakeholder?
- **Context snapshot**: log prior knowledge, constraints, and known biases before collecting new information.

## 2. Breadth-First Discovery
1. **Landscape scan**
   - Establish terminology variants (industry jargon, academic labels, competing vendor phrases).
   - Map the stakeholder ecosystem (regulators, analysts, vendors, practitioners, community forums).
2. **Source sweep**
   - Quick-pass search queries across the general web, scholarly databases, news, and grey literature.
   - Capture meta-data (title, author, publication date, URL) in the notes grid for later citation.
3. **Signal triage**
   - Bookmark high-potential items using a confidence tag (High/Medium/Low) and rationale.
   - Identify emerging themes or contradictions to guide deeper investigation.

## 3. Depth-Focused Exploration
1. **Prioritize themes** based on decision impact, novelty, and evidence gaps.
2. **Follow the citation trail**: move from summaries → primary research → underlying datasets.
3. **Engage domain experts**: seek interviews, webinars, or practitioner blogs where ambiguity remains.
4. **Record dissenting views** to stress-test assumptions early.

## 4. Synthesis Readiness
- Summarize each theme in a claims → evidence table before writing prose.
- Flag where data is outdated, low-signal, or based on single-source assertions.
- Capture open questions requiring additional research or stakeholder validation.

## Evidence Grading Rubric
| Grade | Description | Usage Guidance |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **A — Authoritative** | Peer-reviewed research, official regulatory guidance, audited datasets, or direct stakeholder documents. | Anchor key claims and recommendations.|
| **B — Corroborated** | Established industry reports, well-cited whitepapers, reputable news outlets with multiple confirmations. | Use for supporting arguments when combined with other sources.|
| **C — Indicative** | Practitioner blogs, conference talks, vendor materials with disclosed methodology, survey snapshots. | Provide context or highlight trends—note assumptions.|
| **D — Anecdotal** | Forum posts, single-person accounts, social media threads without corroboration. | Use for signal discovery only; never base conclusions without verification.|

### Quality Gates
- Preference for the most recent, highest-grade evidence available.
- Cross-reference at least two independent sources before elevating a claim beyond "indicative."
- Document the rationale when citing any source below Grade B.

## Source Typology
- **Primary**: First-hand data (interviews, experiments, datasets) or legally binding guidance.
- **Secondary**: Analytical summaries (industry reports, market analyses) interpreting primary material.
- **Tertiary**: Aggregations (encyclopedias, knowledge bases, courseware) useful for orientation only.
- **Grey Literature**: Unpublished or semi-formal works (technical blogs, whitepapers, standards drafts).
- **Community Intelligence**: Forums, Q&A sites, newsletters providing practitioner insight; require validation.
- **Automation Outputs**: AI-generated summaries or tools—log prompts and apply validation before reuse.

Record source type, evidence grade, and access date for every citation to maintain auditability.
