# Project 9: Multi-Region Disaster Recovery Automation

**Category:** Infrastructure & DevOps
**Status:** 🟢 60% Complete
**Source:** [View Code](https://github.com/samueljackson-collab/Portfolio-Project/tree/main/projects/9-disaster-recovery)

## Overview

Resilient multi-region architecture with **automated failover** between AWS regions. Synchronizes stateful services, validates replication health, and performs controlled recovery drills to meet aggressive RTO/RPO targets of <5 minutes.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Region Replication** - Aurora Global Database, S3 cross-region sync, EKS clusters
- **Automated Failover** - Systems Manager runbooks for one-click recovery
- **Health Monitoring** - Route53 health checks with automatic DNS failover
- **Chaos Engineering** - Automated drills to validate recovery procedures
- **RTO/RPO Tracking** - Metrics for recovery time and data loss objectives

## Architecture

```
Primary Region (us-east-1)          Secondary Region (us-west-2)
─────────────────────────            ─────────────────────────
Application (EKS)                    Application (EKS) - Standby
       ↓                                      ↓
Aurora PostgreSQL ──────────────→ Aurora Global Database (Read Replica)
       ↓                                      ↓
S3 Buckets ──────Cross-Region────→ S3 Buckets (Replicated)
       ↓              Replication            ↓
Route53 Health Check ─────────────→ Automatic DNS Failover
```

**Failover Process:**
1. **Detection**: Route53 health check fails in primary region
2. **Notification**: CloudWatch alarm triggers SNS notification
3. **Automation**: Systems Manager runbook executes
4. **Promotion**: Aurora read replica promoted to writer
5. **DNS Update**: Route53 switches to secondary region
6. **Verification**: Health checks confirm successful failover

## Technologies

- **Terraform** - Infrastructure as code
- **AWS Aurora Global Database** - Multi-region database replication
- **AWS Route53** - DNS with health-based failover
- **AWS Systems Manager** - Automation runbooks
- **AWS EKS** - Kubernetes clusters in both regions
- **AWS S3** - Cross-region replication
- **AWS CloudWatch** - Monitoring and alerting
- **Bash** - Automation scripts
- **Chaos Toolkit** - Chaos engineering framework

## Quick Start

```bash
cd projects/9-disaster-recovery

# Deploy infrastructure to both regions
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file=production.tfvars

# Run failover drill
./scripts/failover-drill.sh --region us-west-2 --dry-run

# Execute actual failover (emergency)
./scripts/failover-drill.sh --region us-west-2 --execute

# Failback to primary
./scripts/failover-drill.sh --region us-east-1 --execute
```

```

## Business Impact

- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime SLA with multi-region architecture
- **RTO**: <5 minutes recovery time objective (automated failover)
- **RPO**: <1 minute data loss (Aurora Global Database lag)
- **Compliance**: Meets SOC 2, HIPAA disaster recovery requirements
- **Cost**: $8K/month for full DR vs $50K+ for traditional active-active

## Current Status

**Completed:**
- ✅ Terraform infrastructure for multi-region VPC
- ✅ Aurora Global Database configuration
- ✅ Route53 health checks and failover policies
- ✅ Manual failover runbook documentation
- ✅ Basic failover automation script

**In Progress:**
- 🟡 Complete Terraform modules for all resources
- 🟡 Systems Manager automation documents
- 🟡 Chaos engineering test suite
- 🟡 EKS multi-region deployment

**Next Steps:**
1. Finish Terraform modules for Aurora, EKS, S3 replication
2. Create AWS Systems Manager Automation runbooks
3. Implement chaos experiments with Chaos Toolkit
4. Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
5. Build automated testing for failover/failback
6. Document RTO/RPO measurement methodology
7. Create disaster recovery playbooks
8. Schedule quarterly DR drills and reports

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Multi-region architecture design
- Disaster recovery planning and execution
- Database replication strategies
- DNS-based failover patterns
- Chaos engineering principles
- Infrastructure automation with Terraform
- RTO/RPO metrics and SLA management
