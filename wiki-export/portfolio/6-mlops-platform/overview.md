# Project 6: MLOps Platform
> **Category:** Machine Learning & AI | **Status:** 🟢 60% Complete
> **Source:** projects/25-portfolio-website/docs/projects/06-mlops.md

## 📋 Executive Summary

End-to-end MLOps workflow for training, evaluating, registering, and deploying machine learning models. Combines **MLflow** for experiment tracking, **Optuna** for automated hyperparameter tuning, and modular deployment targeting Kubernetes, AWS Lambda, or Amazon SageMaker.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Experiment Tracking** - MLflow integration for metrics, parameters, and artifacts
- **AutoML Optimization** - Optuna-powered hyperparameter search
- **Model Registry** - Versioned model storage with promotion workflows
- **Multi-Platform Deployment** - Kubernetes, Lambda, and SageMaker support
- **Drift Monitoring** - Automated model performance tracking and retraining triggers

## 🏗️ Architecture

                                     ↓
                   Optuna Hyperparameter Optimization
                                     ↓
                         Model Registry (Versioned)
                                     ↓
              Deployment (K8s / Lambda / SageMaker)

                    Retraining Pipeline (Triggered)
```

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Data Ingestion**: Load training data from S3, databases, or data lakes
2. **Preprocessing**: Feature engineering, scaling, encoding
3. **Training**: Model training with experiment logging
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optuna optimization trials
5. **Evaluation**: Metrics calculation and model comparison
6. **Registry**: Promote best models to staging/production
7. **Deployment**: Containerized serving or serverless inference
8. **Monitoring**: Performance metrics and drift detection
