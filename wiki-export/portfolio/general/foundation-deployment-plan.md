# Foundation Deployment Plan
**Enterprise Portfolio Projects - Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation**

> **Historical snapshot**: This plan reflects an early Phase 1 deployment roadmap. For the current deployment guidance, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the deployment strategy for the three foundational projects that will host and support the remaining 22 portfolio projects. Following the **Foundation-First → Vertical Completion** approach, we establish shared infrastructure before completing projects by category.

## Risk Mitigation

### AWS Costs
- **Risk:** Running EKS + RDS 24/7 is expensive (~$150-200/month)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use Spot instances (already configured in Terraform)
  - Tear down dev environment when not demoing
  - Use t3.micro/t3.small for dev
  - Set up billing alerts

### Time Constraints
- **Risk:** 25 projects may take longer than 12 weeks
- **Mitigation:**
  - Focus on 5-8 "hero projects" with live demos
  - Document others with architecture + code
  - Use AI prompt suggestions from review to accelerate

### Technical Blockers
- **Risk:** Complex integrations may fail
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start simple (MVP), iterate
  - Use managed services where possible
  - Document what WOULD be done in production
