# GitHub Audit Report — 2025-11-13

This report summarizes repository governance and security findings identified during the deployment readiness review.

## Highlights

- **CI Enforcement:** Tests now fail for pull requests and for pushes to `main`, preventing regressions from entering production. Diagnostic runs on other branches remain possible.
- **Secret Management:** `.env` files and AWS profiles are recommended throughout the docs to reduce the risk of plaintext secrets.
- **Monitoring Assets:** Provisioning files for Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana are version-controlled with validation targets.

## Outstanding Actions

| Area | Observation | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dependency Updates | Backend dependencies lack dependabot automation. | Enable Dependabot for Python and Docker ecosystems. |
| Grafana Credentials | Default admin credentials must be rotated post-deployment. | Store secrets in GitHub environments and inject at runtime. |
| Documentation Sprawl | Multiple readiness guides overlap. | Consolidate references in `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` with canonical links. |

## Verification Checklist

- [x] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` uses conditional execution that still enforces tests on pull requests.
- [x] Prometheus configuration validated via `make validate-prometheus`.
- [x] Alertmanager receivers documented with placeholder webhook URLs to avoid leaking sensitive data.
