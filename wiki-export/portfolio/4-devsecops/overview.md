# Project 4: DevSecOps Pipeline
> **Category:** Infrastructure & DevOps | **Status:** 🟡 25% Complete
> **Source:** projects/25-portfolio-website/docs/projects/04-devsecops.md

## 📋 Executive Summary

Security-first CI/CD pipeline integrating **SAST, DAST, and container scanning** into the software delivery workflow. Generates Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and enforces security policies before deployment.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Shift-Left Security** - Vulnerabilities caught early in development
- **Automated Scanning** - Code, dependencies, and container images
- **SBOM Generation** - Complete inventory of software components
- **Policy Gates** - Block deployment on critical/high vulnerabilities
- **Compliance Reports** - Automated security posture documentation

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Code Commit → SAST Scan → Dependency Check → Build Image
                ↓              ↓                  ↓
            SonarQube        Snyk          Trivy/Clair
                ↓              ↓                  ↓
              Policy Gate (Pass/Fail)
                      ↓
               DAST Scan (Staging)
                      ↓
              Deploy Production
```

**Security Stages:**
1. **SAST**: Static code analysis (SonarQube, Semgrep)
2. **Dependency Scan**: Vulnerable library detection (Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check)
3. **Container Scan**: Image vulnerability scan (Trivy, Clair)
4. **SBOM**: Generate software bill of materials (Syft)
5. **DAST**: Dynamic application testing in staging (OWASP ZAP)
6. **Policy Enforcement**: Fail pipeline on critical issues

### Components

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| GitHub Actions | GitHub Actions | CI/CD orchestration |
| SonarQube | SonarQube | Code quality and security analysis |
| Snyk | Snyk | Dependency vulnerability scanning |

## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Adopt GitHub Actions
**Context:** Project 4: DevSecOps Pipeline requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** CI/CD orchestration
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

### Decision 2: Adopt SonarQube
**Context:** Project 4: DevSecOps Pipeline requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** Code quality and security analysis
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

### Decision 3: Adopt Snyk
**Context:** Project 4: DevSecOps Pipeline requires a resilient delivery path.
**Decision:** Dependency vulnerability scanning
**Outcome:** Practices captured in RUNBOOK.md support ongoing operations.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

```bash
cd projects/4-devsecops

# Run security scans locally
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src sonarqube:latest sonar-scanner
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock aquasec/trivy image myapp:latest

# Generate SBOM
syft packages dir:. -o spdx-json > sbom.json
```
