# Portfolio Master Index — Complete Package

This index consolidates the full portfolio hand-off, covering governance briefs, assessments, engineering artifacts, deployment references, and supporting appendices. Use this file as the canonical roadmap for every document included in the delivery bundle.

## Section Overview

| Track | Description | Key Artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Executive Alignment | Summaries for leadership, including current status, outstanding risks, and prioritized initiatives. | `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`, `COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`, `SURVEY_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` |
| Portfolio Health | Deep dives into assessments, progress tracking, and audit outcomes. | `PORTFOLIO_ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md`, `PORTFOLIO_COMPLETION_PROGRESS.md`, `AUDIT_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` |
| Engineering Delivery | Code quality breakdowns, implementation notes, enhancement plans, and remediation tasks. | `CODE_QUALITY_REPORT.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md`, `CODE_ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`, `CRITICAL_FIXES_APPLIED.md` |
| Testing & QA | Results from automated and manual testing, including generated suites and summary tables. | `TEST_SUMMARY.md`, `TEST_GENERATION_COMPLETE.md`, `TEST_SUITE_SUMMARY.md`, `PROJECT_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md` |
| Deployment & Operations | Guides for rollout, configuration, and operational readiness. | `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `FOUNDATION_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`, `CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md`, `HOW_TO_USE_THIS_ANALYSIS.md` |

> **Tip:** Use the `Portfolio_Navigation_Guide.md` to quickly map persona-specific journeys (leadership, engineering, operations) across these artifacts.

## Workflow Alignment

1. **Discover** — Review executive and portfolio health sections to understand scope and priorities.
2. **Plan** — Use engineering delivery and remediation documents to scope upcoming sprints.
3. **Build** — Follow deployment and configuration guides for consistent environments.
4. **Validate** — Leverage QA assets to confirm coverage and guard against regressions.
5. **Report** — Update completion summaries and survey outputs to communicate progress.

## Index Maintenance Checklist

- [x] All referenced files exist within the repository root or `docs/` tree.
- [x] Markdown validation completed (headings, tables, and diagrams render correctly).
- [x] Navigation guide cross-references updated.
- [ ] Next release artifacts added (leave unchecked until new documents arrive).
