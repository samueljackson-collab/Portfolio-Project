## Pull Requests Reviewed

### PR #72: "Fix README project links"

**Status:** Open  
**Review Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Content Incorporated:** Partially

**Summary:**
- This PR renamed directories from `projects/` to `infrastructure/` and `documentation/`
- Created placeholder READMEs for project directories
- However, current main branch still uses `projects/` structure

**Decision:**
- Used the current main branch structure (`projects/`) as authoritative
- Did not incorporate the directory restructuring from PR #72
- Focused on populating READMEs in the existing structure

### PR #83: "Add project folders and align highlighted project status"

**Status:** Open  
**Review Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Content Incorporated:** Substantially

**Summary:**
- This PR added comprehensive project READMEs with executive summaries
- Created folders: `projects/homelab/`, `projects/virtualization/`, `projects/observability/`, `projects/ecommerce/`
- Added detailed descriptions and artifact planning

**Decision:**
- Incorporated the improved project descriptions and status indicators
- Used the structure and naming conventions from this PR where applicable
- Extended the approach to cover all project folders mentioned in main README

### Other Reviewed PRs

The following PRs were also reviewed but contained content not directly applicable to the current task:

- **PR #93**: "Fix README project links" - Similar to #72, focused on restructuring
- **PR #96**: "Refocus README on infrastructure portfolio case studies" - Major rewrite, not incorporated
- **PR #95**: "Refocus README on infrastructure portfolio case studies" - Duplicate of #96
- **PR #81-88**: Various project-specific documentation that didn't affect link structure

## Template Structure for Created READMEs

Each placeholder README follows this consistent structure:

```markdown
# [Project Title]

**Status:** [Status Emoji and Text]

## Description

[Project description from top-level README]

## Links

- [Evidence/Diagrams](./assets) (if assets folder exists)
- [Parent Documentation](../README.md) (if parent README exists)

## Next Steps

This is a placeholder README. Documentation and evidence will be added as the project progresses.

*Placeholder â€” Documentation pending*
```

## Project Metadata Preservation

All placeholder content includes:
- **Status indicators** from the top-level README (ðŸŸ¢ Done, ðŸŸ  In Progress, ðŸ”µ Planned, ðŸ”„ Recovery)
- **Descriptions** extracted from the project listings in README.md
- **Clear placeholder marking** to indicate this is interim content
- **Contact information** for follow-up questions
- **Links** to related directories (assets, parent docs)

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Steps Performed

1. âœ… Verified all 21 directories were created
2. âœ… Confirmed each README.md contains >200 characters (meaningful content threshold)
3. âœ… Validated link text consistency across README.md
4. âœ… Ensured status indicators match top-level README
5. âœ… Verified placeholder marking is present in all created files

### Link Resolution Test

All previously broken links now resolve:
- Directory links â†’ Point to README.md in the directory
- Asset links â†’ Point to assets/README.md
- All link text uses consistent "Project README" terminology

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Content Development**: Replace placeholder content with actual project documentation
2. **Asset Population**: Add diagrams, configurations, and evidence to assets folders
3. **Link Refinement**: Review and update link descriptions to be more specific
4. **Status Updates**: Keep status indicators synchronized with actual project progress
5. **Cross-Linking**: Add more internal links between related projects
6. **Directory Structure**: Consider the restructuring proposed in PR #72 once content is stable

## Files Changed Summary

- **Created:** 21 new README.md files
- **Modified:** 1 file (README.md - link text updates)
- **Deleted:** 0 files
- **Total changes:** 22 files

## Conclusion

This automated remediation successfully addressed all 21 broken local links by creating consistent, well-structured placeholder README files. All project directories now have documentation, and the top-level README uses consistent link text. The repository is now in a better state for contributors to add detailed content to each project folder.
